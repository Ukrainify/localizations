Prone to tumbling over due to its top-heavy design and unable to pivot its main turret up or down, the pilots of these botched battle vehicles rely on clumsily stomping their enemies underfoot as the most reliable means of victory.

Those that point out the obvious fallacy of aerial warriors wearing incredibly heavy armour invariably find themselves crushed beneath a pile of angry elbow-dropping Garths.
