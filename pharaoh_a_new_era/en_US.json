  "Encyclo/#Granary_Title": "Granary",
  "Encyclo/#Granary_Content": "Because farming was largely impossible during the Inundation, granaries were vitally important to ensure that the ancient Egyptians were fed year-round. Granaries not only stored grain and other foods, but also manufactured flour.  \nThe granary evolved over time. In the Archaic period, the Egyptian granary was shaped like a cone with a domed top. They were made from wood or brick, and the largest ones had ladders or steps leading to the filling hole. In the Middle Kingdom, the granary was shaped like a quadrangle and had a flat roof with several filling holes, like those depicted in our game. A third type of granary was used only for seed to be sown during the next growing season. These granaries were shaped like a trapezoid, a distinctly different shape than granaries used for food storage, so that the seed grain would not be eaten by mistake. \nMost granaries were strictly maintained by the government. Soldiers, construction workers and other non-agricultural workers all ate from these granaries. Some wealthy private citizens had their own granaries, and some peasants had their own small granaries to store whatever part of the harvest they were allowed to keep.",
  "Encyclo/#StorageYard_Title": "Storage Yard",
  "Encyclo/#StorageYard_Content": "In ancient Egypt, there were storage magazines in both the temple and the palace for state goods. These would have been roofed structures, and mostly everything would have been stored in large pottery vessels. Open-air storage facilities in the middle of the city was unlikely. There was the occasional rain storm, but also the flood could be dangerous and there would be the occasional flash flood which would be detrimental to towns. They were well supervised by scribes who kept strict track of the inventory. \nThe design of the storage yard in the game thus does not reflect the reality, this choice was made to allow the player to quickly see what's in stock at any moment in time.",
  "Encyclo/#Farming_Title": "Farming",
  "Encyclo/#Farming_Content": "Farming and agriculture were the basis of the Egyptian economy. Abundant crops allowed Egypt to <link=\"#Trade_Title\"><u>trade</u></link> with neighbors, bringing new goods into Egypt. \nThe key to successful farming was the Inundation, in the season called akhet. Every year, the Nile flooded its banks, re-fertilizing the soil. As long as the Inundation occurred, the Egyptians could count on having plenty of food to eat. In years of low or no Inundation, famine struck Egypt, which was sometimes enough to topple governments. \nTo take advantage of the restoring Inundation, dykes were built around farms to capture the water as it rose. As the Nile receded (the season called peret), the water, along with its nutrients, slowly soaked into the soil. After about six weeks, the farmer opened the dykes and let the rest of the water drain out. Of course, being submerged in water made the ground quite soft. Before he could sow his seed, the farmer had to wait for the land to dry out a little and become firm. \nFinally, during the season of shemu, the crops were harvested. Crops meant for Egyptian consumption were stored in <link=\"#Granary_Title\"><u>granaries</u></link>. Food for export was stored in <link=\"#StorageYard_Title\"><u>Storage Yards</u></link> until it could be loaded onto barges. \nGovernment-owned farms and farms owned by Estate owners employed laborers to do many of the most arduous tasks on the land. Farming was not easy work, and much of the work was done by hand. The tools farmers had at their disposal included the hoe, the hand-held plough, and the sickle. Domesticated oxen eased some of the plowing. \nFarming produced both raw materials and foodstuffs. <link=\"#Grain_Title\"><u>Grain & Barley</u></link> were key food crops, and <link=\"#Flax_Title\"><u>flax</u></link>, which was manufactured into <link=\"#Linen_Title\"><u>linen</u></link>, was the most important raw material crop. \nFarming and agriculture were also integral to the Egyptian afterlife. Once the deceased has been granted entry into the afterlife, he finds himself working the soil in the Field of Reeds.",
  "Encyclo/#Industry_Title": "Industry",
  "Encyclo/#Industry_Content": "By the Old Kingdom, manufacture of products had moved out of the domestic setting and into centralized workshops which turned out nearly all the supplies needed for daily life. Each workshop specialized in a particular product and operated very much like a modern assembly line. Each worker was responsible for a particular aspect of the finished product, rather than working on an item from beginning to end. The tools the artisans used in these workshops were the property of the state, as were any materials the workshops produced. Craftsmen earned wages, usually paid in food and necessary goods. \nEgyptian industry thrived and produced many products. Egyptians could find employment as <link=\"#Pottery_Title\"><u>potters</u></link>, <link=\"#Linen_Title\"><u>weavers</u></link>, <link=\"#Jewelry_Title\"><u>jewelers</u></link>, tanners, <link=\"#Carpenters_Title\"><u>carpenters</u></link> and smelters as well as bakers and <link=\"#Beer_Title\"><u>brewers</u></link>.",
  "Encyclo/#Housing_Title": "Housing",
  "Encyclo/#Housing_Content": "Egyptians made their homes from brick, wood, mud or occasionally stone. Housing style and size depended upon the wealth of the citizen and where they lived. Thus, rural citizens who farmed for a living resided in simple brick or pressed mud structures of two to four rooms. City homes of the working class were likewise small, and some two-story, two-family homes were built to save space in the most crowded cities. City-dwelling workers lived in brick homes of maybe 3 to 5 rooms. \nWealthier citizens had larger homes, and some of these were quite spacious. Senior government officials had estates that included large-scale houses, gardens, associated workshops, private granaries, and houses for servants. The most luxurious homes of all were the <link=\"#PharaohsHome_Title\"><u>Pharaoh's palaces</u></link>.  \nFor the most part, Egyptian cities grew organically in whichever direction they could. A few cities, however, were planned, most notably the settlement built for workers at Deir el-Medina. \nMost Egyptian cities were surrounded by walls.

  "Encyclo/#Roads_Title": "Roads",
  "Encyclo/#Roads_Content": "The <link=\"#Nile_Title\"><u>Nile</u></link> was Egypt's main highway. Boats of all shapes and sizes transported people, goods and materials from one point to another. The ancient Egyptians, of course, had land-based roads as well. These roads were generally not paved in any fashion but were simply well-worn paths. In most cities, roads twisted and turned in any way necessary. In planned cities, such as the settlement for workers at Deir el-Medina, the roads were laid out in a neat grid. \nSome trade routes were also well-established, but these roads weren't paved, either - and they could be quite dangerous to traverse. For more on the perils of successful trade, click <link=\"#Trade_Title\"><u>here</u></link>.",
  "Encyclo/#Irrigation_Title": "Irrigation",
  "Encyclo/#Irrigation_Content": "The Egyptians increased the amount of arable land through irrigation. Egyptians began to build a network of irrigation canals and ditches as early as the ninth dynasty, or about 2000 BC. Some canals seem to have existed before then, but they were used for transportation. The irrigation canals extended the benefits of the river, bringing nourishing silt to areas away from the river. \nEarly in Egyptian history, farmers who wanted to irrigate their land had a tough time of it. Farmers irrigated their land by hand, carrying a yoke with two buckets made of clay or leather to the Nile or some other water source. The farmer returned with his buckets of water to his farm, which was subdivided by small dykes. The dykes captured the water, maximizing the benefit of this slow and arduous method of irrigation.  \nAt the beginning of the 18th dynasty (about 1300 BC), the water lift, or shaduf, was introduced. The shaduf probably came to Egypt from Mesopotamia, where it had been in use as early as 2370 BC. Positioned on the bank of the Nile or other water source, the shaduf was made from a long wooden beam that rocked back and forth on a pivot. A bucket at one end of the beam was counterbalanced with a brick or other weight. A person pushed down on the end with the bucket to dip it into the water, and the brick helped the worker lift the water into the gully that was attached to the shaduf. \nThe introduction of the shaduf increased the arable land in Egypt by about 15 percent. Also, because it was never submerged under water, land irrigated by the shaduf could produce two harvests a year instead of one.",
  "Encyclo/#Labor_Title": "Labor",
  "Encyclo/#Labor_Content": "Peasants performed most of the hard labor in ancient Egypt. Peasants tilled the soil and harvested the crops during the growing season. During the Inundation, these same workers were conscripted to do work for the state. They mostly worked to build pyramids and other structures, but these workers could also be tasked with maintaining the Egyptian infrastructure, like <link=\"#Roads_Title\"><u>roads</u></link> and <link=\"#Irrigation_Title\"><u>irrigation ditches</u></link>. \nWhile the work the peasants performed wasn't easy, they received fair treatment and benefits from the government. The typical workday lasted eight hours with a break at lunch. The work week lasted eight days, with two days off at the end. In addition to these 'weekends,' work stopped for festivals. Workers could also take time off if there was sickness or death in the family. \nAttendance was very well documented, as were the reasons for missing work. Some reasons for missing work probably wouldn't be acceptable excuses today. According to an absentee record discovered at Deir el-Medina, one worker missed work to go drinking with a buddy. \nDespite what many people think, slave labor was seldom used on state construction projects. Sometimes, slaves were used in quarries, but for the most part, they served in households. \nIf workers were not treated well, they could go on strike. During Ramses III's reign, about 1152 BC, workers at Deir el-Medina formally stopped work to protest the delay of their compensation. Their strike was successful, and the problem of late compensation was rectified.",
  "Encyclo/#Water_Title": "Well and Water Supply",
  "Encyclo/#Water_Content": "Getting drinking water to the populace was a bit of a challenge in ancient Egypt. The main water source was the Nile and the Nile's water table. Away from the Nile, there were a few oases, but most of the land was arid. \nTo get water to neighborhoods, cisterns were built in well-to-do houses. Water carriers brought buckets full of water to these houses, and emptied them into the cisterns. \nThe Egyptians were adept at digging wells. Workers had to dig through 300 feet of rock for one well near the worker's settlement at Giza. Most wells had a well house capping them. From the well house, stairs wound down to the water's level. From there, people could fill their jugs with water.",
  "Encyclo/#Nile_Title": "Nile",
  "Encyclo/#Nile_Content": "Egyptian civilization simply would not exist without the Nile. In a region where rain is scarce, the Nile provides a reliable source of water to both the people and the land. By flooding its banks on a relatively predictable basis, the Nile also refertilizes farmland. \nThe importance of the Nile was not lost on the ancient Egyptians. Watching the Nile continuously bring the land back to life contributed volumes to Egyptian religious customs, particularly their belief in an afterlife.  \nThe Egyptian calendar was divided into seasons named for the different stages of the Nile. The Inundation, when the Nile was flooding its banks, was called akhet. The Inundation occurred because of yearly monsoons at the source of the Blue Nile on the Ethiopian plateaus. The Emergence, or peret, marked the time when the Nile receded and the land began to emerge. Harvest time was called shemu, sometimes translated as drought.",
  "Encyclo/#Dentistry_Title": "Dentistry",
  "Encyclo/#Dentistry_Content": "Dentistry was one of many fields that an ancient Egyptian doctor could practice. Remains of ancient Egyptians indicate that dentists were fighting an uphill battle. Tooth decay was promoted by omnipresent sand. Sand worked its way into everything, including food, and constantly crunching on sand quickly wore down the Egyptians' teeth. Tooth wear often led to abscesses, which could cause the tooth to fall out and could even cause death. \nMedical papyri detail the actions dentists took to treat specific problems. For example, if a tooth fell out, the dentist bound the tooth to a neighboring tooth with gold or silver wire. There is even a recipe for fillings, involving mixing resin and malachite, but archaeologists have found no remains of teeth with the fillings still intact. \nArcheologists have uncovered tools that they believe were used as toothbrushes. Thus far, no discoveries of ancient Egyptian floss have been reported.",
  "Encyclo/#Apothecary_Title": "Apothecary",
  "Encyclo/#Apothecary_Content": "Ancient Egyptian medicinal and pharmaceutical practices are well-documented. Religion was instrumental in curing disease, and most prescribed cures were accompanied by prayers or spells. Medical papyri outlined specific cures, some of which seem a bit unusual by our standards. \nTo cure indigestion, for instance, a hog's tooth was crushed and placed inside of four sugar cakes. The patient was to eat one of these cakes per day, after which time the indigestion should be cured. \nA cure for baldness called for a mixture of a rook's vertebra, a burnt donkey's hoof and the lard of a black snake.",
  "Encyclo/#Medicine_Title": "Medicine",
  "Encyclo/#Medicine_Content": "Like other parts of Egyptian society, the medical profession was highly segmented and bureaucratic. The profession was organized along hierarchical lines, with doctors holding titles such as senior doctor, inspector, overseer and master of physicians. The highest-ranking doctor was the 'Chief of Physicians of the South and North.' \nDoctors gained their medical knowledge through studying the internal organs of animals and texts, not through observing the embalming process. Medicine was distinctly separate from the funerary rites. \nGood health was anchored in the concept of metu, or channels. The heart was the center of the body, and all parts of the body were linked to the heart by metu. More than a description of the circulatory system, all systems of the body were considered to be metu. Illness occurred when some part of the metu was blocked. \nTo cure illnesses, doctors prescribed medicine combined with prayer. For more on Egyptian pharmaceutical practices, see <link=\"#Apothecary_Title\"><u>apothecaries</u></link>. \nEgyptians suffered from polio, smallpox, tuberculosis of the spine and malaria, among other maladies. The Egyptians were also prone to illness caused by parasitic worms.",
  "Encyclo/#Embalmers_Title": "Embalmers",
  "Encyclo/#Embalmers_Content": "Embalming is the cornerstone of ancient Egyptian funerary customs. The ka, or spirit, of the deceased needed a place to live in the afterlife and, thus, needed its body. During the embalming process, the body was first rinsed in the waters of the Nile, symbolizing rebirth. Then, internal organs were removed from the corpse and stored in containers called canopic jars. The only organ that was discarded was the brain (which was removed through the nose) because the ancient Egyptians believed that it served no purpose. The canopic jars were entombed with the body. \nAfter removing the internal organs, the embalmer filled the body cavity with perfumes, oils, and linen and closed the body up. Then, the body was covered in natron, a type of salt. After 70 days, the body was rinsed off, wrapped in linen and smeared with bitumen. The bitumen helped to kill bacteria and fungi that would otherwise work to decompose the body. \nBecause of the expense of the embalming process, only the wealthiest citizens were able to afford it.",
  "Encyclo/#Temples_Title": "Shrine and Temple",
  "Encyclo/#Temples_Content": "Temples were viewed as the residences of the gods, and each temple had scores of attending <link=\"#Priests_Title\"><u>priests</u></link> to care for the god. Citizens took part in the care of the gods through offerings, but they rarely saw the statue of the god hidden deep inside the temple. Only on feast days, when the god was carried through town on a ceremonial bark, did citizens actually catch a glimpse of the deity, though the deity was still hidden within a portable shrine.\nEgyptians turned to the gods for advice. Everyone was welcome into the forecourt of the temple, and here people could query the gods regarding subjects that puzzled them or ask forgiveness for past wrongs. The priests, hidden from view, responded to the beseechers. Citizens could also ask questions of the god on feast days when the god was out and about. \nIn addition to paying homage at the temples, most Egyptians had shrines in their homes. Frequently, the shrine was of Bes, the protector god of the household. Individuals seem to have had their own patron gods as well. In an attendance record uncovered at Deir el-Medina, workers are sometimes absent to celebrate the 'festival of their god.' \nThe concept of a patron god extended to cities, towns and regions.

  "Encyclo/#Education_Content": "Education in ancient Egypt was extremely practical. Each person was educated with a specific career in mind. For many, education meant apprenticeship, and sons were generally apprenticed to their fathers to learn a craft. Some girls, too, were apprenticed to pursue careers as dancers, singers or weavers, but for the most part girls learned the art of managing a household. \nScribes received the most formal education. Scribal schools, called Per-Ankh or 'house of life,' were connected primarily to temples, but also scribes would have been schooled in the king's palace. Here, would-be scribes learned the written languages, primarily hieratic and, later, demotic, which were used for everyday business. Some were schooled in the arcane hieroglyphs. The scribes learned their craft by copying over manuscripts onto ostraca, or old shards of stone. Only when they had mastered their craft were they entrusted with papyrus. \nDiscipline was demanded, and physical punishment frequent. Scribal education generally occurred between the ages of 10 and 20.",

Those who knew how to read, particularly those associated with the pharaoh's court, could gain access to the libraries and read papyri for themselves.\nAncient Egyptian literature could be divided into several different genres, including autobiography, adventure tales, folktales, mythology, lament, poetry, and hymns, among others. Of these forms, autobiography was the oldest and came from the tradition of engraving a person's accomplishments on his tomb. Satire was also popular.",

Sports were common, especially water sports like rowing and swimming (the wealthiest enjoyed this sport from the privacy of their own swimming pools). The Egyptians were also known to engage in fishing as a leisure activity. \nBoxing was a popular spectator sport, with bouts arranged specifically for the pharaoh's entertainment. Other sports included handball, a form of field hockey, gymnastics, archery and weightlifting. \nReading was a popular diversion for the educated, and the first known short story was written in ancient Egypt. Poetry was popular, but there is no clear evidence of any Egyptian plays, however, you might consider re-enactments of religious stories during festivals, such as the story of Osiris, to be plays of a sort.

Lower-class children followed their parents out to the fields and helped in the harvest. Middle- and upper-class children spent their days at home with their mother. When they were old enough, upper-class boys would be sent to school and then apprenticed to their fathers. \nEgyptian children had plenty of toys and games at their disposal, including balls, dolls, tops and wooden animals. They played games, like tug of war, and enjoyed many of the same leisure pursuits as their parents, such as swimming and fishing. \nChildren and their parents also kept a variety of pets.

  "Encyclo/#Society_Content": "Egyptian society was highly stratified with distinct and separate classes. For the most part, people remained in the class into which they were born, although there are a few examples of individuals marrying into a higher class. \nMembers of the lowest class were peasants. The peasants had the shortest life expectancy of any class and endured a life of hard labor, either on farms or on state construction projects. Their remains show that most peasants had bad back problems, and their vertebrae were sometimes fused together as a result of their hard work. They lived in very basic structures of a few rooms, and they were buried in simple graves and could not afford to be embalmed. \nThe middle class was comprised of artisans, merchants, and others involved in industry. They lived in more spacious homes and some of them could afford embalming and modest tombs. \nThe wealthiest class were high-ranking government officials. They could afford the finest luxuries, including embalming, and often had fine tombs built. Their diets were richer and more varied than other Egyptians. In an examination of some mummified remains of upper class Egyptians, 10 to 20 percent had arteriosclerosis - hardening of the arteries - indicating the consumption of plenty of animal fat and, perhaps, a life of stress.

Singers were an integral part of Egyptian music, and most of the hymns and poems recorded on papyri were possibly meant to be sung to music. \nPercussion instruments were particularly used in accompanying <link=\"#Dance_Title\"><u>dance</u></link>. Many dancers played castanets as they performed. \nThe Egyptians also played trumpets. Trumpets were associated with the military (perhaps the Egyptians had their own form of reveille) and are frequently found in the tombs of kings and military leaders. Two trumpets were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. To hear what the trumpets sounded like, one of them was played in 1939. After a few notes, the trumpet promptly fell apart. It was restored immediately. The trumpet was also associated with <link=\"#Osiris_Title\"><u>Osiris</u></link>, God of Agriculture and the Nile Flood. \nOther instruments also had religious significance.

Some citizens also danced as a pastime, although this diversion was reserved primarily for the lower classes. The greater an Egyptian's stature, the less likely he or she was to dance. Also, men and women never danced together. Women danced with other women, and men danced with other men. \nApparently, Egyptian dance moves were named for what they represented, for example, 'the leading along of an animal,' 'the successful capture of a boat' and 'the funky chicken.'",

It was played by two players, and each player had at least five pieces. Moves were determined by a set of four throwing sticks. The rules for senet were not recorded anywhere, so no one is quite sure how the game was played. Most historians agree, however, that the game represented the journey to the afterlife. Both backgammon and hopscotch are considered to be descendants of senet. \nSenet, along with other games, was probably one of many amusements Egyptians undertook while at taverns or inns.

Heading everything up, of course, was the pharaoh. The pharaoh's right-hand man was his vizier, who was responsible for ensuring that all pharaonic commands were carried out. Under the vizier were nomarchs (regional governors), chancellors, viceroys, overseers, mayors - the list goes on and on. And, because ancient Egypt was a theocracy, <link=\"#Priests_Title\"><u>priests</u></link> played an integral part. \nMany individuals held more than one title.

  "Encyclo/#Trade_Title": "Trade",
  "Encyclo/#Trade_Content": "While ancient Egypt was replete with natural resources, the land did lack some goods. The Egyptians opened trade routes with many nearby countries and regions, including Nubia, Lebanon, Syria, Punt (which historians speculate is the coast of Somalia) and the Aegean, among others. Some sources claim that Egyptian trade extended as far north as modern-day Turkey. \nThe Nile again played an important role in Egyptian trade. The river was navigable through the first cataract, or set of rocky waterfalls. It acted as a road and made travel to and from Nubia relatively easy. \nThe Nile also helped to provide one of Egypt's main exports: grain. The Inundation proved to be much more reliable than the rain in Lebanon and Syria. As long as the Inundation occurred, Egypt had a surplus of grain, a luxury Lebanon and Syria did not frequently have. Egypt's other exports included linen, papyrus, lentils, dried fish, gold and silver vessels, ox hides and rope. \nIn exchange, Egypt received a variety of goods as imports. Among the most important are gold from Nubia, wood from Lebanon and olive oil from Syria. The Egyptians also imported other luxury items, such as myrrh and wine, and livestock. The Egyptians also occasionally imported weapons. \nLaden with goods, caravans were especially prone to attack. For protection, armed units accompanied caravans on their trade missions. Because of these armed units, some historians speculate that Egypt did not always engage in free trade with its neighbors, but rather bullied neighbors into giving up goods. While coercion probably played some role in Egyptian trade, some papyri also refer to negotiations between Egypt and its trade partners. There are several documents inscribed on clay tablets that give details of luxury goods sent to and from kings of the Near East. Punt and Crete always had peaceful trade.\nSome successful trade missions were celebrated with inscriptions and artwork. Hatshepsut, a female pharaoh, sent a fleet of ships to Punt to procure myrrh, frankincense, ivory and other fine goods. The trip was deemed so successful that it is recorded on the walls of Hatshepsut's temple at Deir el-Bahri.",
  "Encyclo/#Ships_Title": "Ships and Ship Making",
  "Encyclo/#Ships_Content": "The Nile has inspired boat makers for ages. In pre-Dynastic times, ancient Egyptians lashed together reeds of papyrus to make rafts that they propelled with poles. Not long before the advent of pyramid building, there were advancements in building boats that would be helpful and even necessary for large-scale construction projects. Ships were important in transporting heavy materials needed for the construction of the pyramids. \nLike other industries in Egypt, shipwrights were government-owned operations. Equipped with woodworking tools, ship builders first made the hull of the boat by laying planks side by side and securing them with dowels, glue, and ropes designed to shrink when wet. When the ropes shrank, the hull was held fast. Hulls of larger boats were ribbed. Once the hull was complete, the shipwrights outfitted the rest of the boat, including a mast for the sail and holes for oars. Some of the larger ships had cabins. \nThe ships were broad-beamed and designed to ride very high on the surface of the water, which helped them stay afloat. The Nile, though relatively easy to navigate, did have its share of shoals and shallow points, and it was easy for ships to run aground. \nShipwrights built ships of significant size. One boat, used to transport obelisks to Hatshepsut's temple, measured 89 yards (82 meters) in length. One of the most famous archaeological finds is Khufu's barge. Found in about 1,224 pieces along the south side of Khufu's pyramid, the barge was reconstructed in the early 1960s. The boat is over 46 yards (42 meters) long and 6.5 yards (6 meters) wide, with spots for 10 rowers plus an additional two that steered the boat. Historians are unsure of the significance of the boat. Some speculate that it is symbolic of Horus' sun ship. Others think that it may have been the barge that transported Khufu's remains to his pyramid, or that he used the boat during life. Regardless, the boat provides insight into the construction of Egyptian ships.",
  "Encyclo/#Enemies_Title": "Enemies",
  "Encyclo/#Enemies_Content": "Egypt was in frequent contact with its neighbors, and sometimes relations weren't very friendly. Egypt was invaded several times during its long history and occasionally ruled by non-Egyptians. These non-Egyptians, though, assumed the title of pharaoh, and up until the time of the Persian invasion, Egyptians managed to wrestle back their land. Egypt, though, was not always the one under attack. During the New Kingdom in particular, Egypt sought to expand its empire and invaded many neighboring lands. \nAmong the peoples Egypt waged war against are the Nubians and the Kushites. Egypt invaded Nubia fairly early in its history (as early as 2900 BC), mostly to take advantage of Nubia's rich gold and copper resources. During the Third Intermediate Period (ca. 747-656 BC), however, Nubia gained the upper hand, and several Nubian pharaohs ruled Egypt. \nAcross the Sinai peninsula, in the Levant, were several peoples with whom Egypt waged war. Among these are the Canaanites, Philistines, Mitannians, Assyrians, Bedouins (from what is now Syria), and the Hittites. The most notable of the Levantine peoples, though, are the Hyksos. During the Second Intermediate Period, the Hyksos ruled Egypt. They retained many of Egypt's cultural practices and introduced many innovations, such as the horse-drawn chariot. The Hyksos ruled Egypt for about 200 years until Ahmose I, an Egyptian king ruling from southern Egypt, defeated them and reunited Upper and Lower Egypt once more. \nTo the west, Egypt engaged in war with Libyan tribes, particularly the Tehenu and Temehu. The Tehenu and Temehu attempted to move into the Egyptian Delta, and they were put down strongly by Seti I. <link=\"#Defenses_Title\"><u>Forts</u></link> were built in the west to help keep the tribes at bay. \nFinally, the powerful Roman Empire reached the shores of Egypt during the rule of the Ptolemies. Egypt's waning military might yet bountiful treasury and granaries (not to mention the beguiling Cleopatra VII) quite naturally attracted the covetous eyes of Julius Caesar and his successors. The arrival of Caesar's Roman legions on Egyptian soil marked a major power shift in the Mediterranean basin which eventually reduced the once-independent and powerful Egypt to a Roman province. \nClick <link=\"#Military_Title\"><u>here</u></link> for more on Egypt's military.",

Excavations at Abu (Elephantine), located in southern Egypt near the Nubian border, have uncovered a thick, curving wall.  \nEgypt defended its borders with a series of fortresses. Among the most well known of these fortresses are the 'Wall of the Prince,' a series of 13 fortresses built along the Nile's east bank.",
  "Encyclo/#Law_Title": "Law",
  "Encyclo/#Law_Content": "Egyptians with grievances against others could take their complaints to a magistrate. Depending on the seriousness of the offense, the case might be decided by a local magistrate or by the vizier himself. Local magistrates were sometimes lower-ranking officials in the town, like a chief workman. Scribes attended the court cases and recorded participants, witnesses, testimony and punishments. \nEveryone was subject to the law, upper and lower classes alike. In one scene engraved on a mastaba chapel of an Old Kingdom vizier, local governors are being punished for withholding tax revenue. Women, too, were active participants in court cases. In one case, a woman is awarded property that had been illegally claimed by her in-laws. In another case, a woman is found guilty of stealing a tool and a vessel from a shrine of Amun. \nPunishments for crime could be quite severe and frequently involved beatings or forced labor. During the New Kingdom's 18th dynasty, the punishment for stealing hides was 100 blows and five open wounds. Some particularly heinous crimes were punishable by cutting off the criminal's nose and banishing him or her to the outskirts of Egypt. \nEgyptian law was not strictly codified, and most punishments were meted out on a case-by-case basis. There are some lists of crimes and their punishments remaining, particularly from the New Kingdom, but these lists tend to be contradictory. \nJustice was an important concept in the afterlife as well. Before a person could enter the afterlife, he or she had to make a 'negative confession,' listing all the bad things the person hadn't done during his lifetime. After the negative confession, the individual's heart is weighed against a feather from Ma'at's headdress. If the heart weighs the same as the feather, he or she gains admittance into the afterlife. If it is heavier than the feather, the heart is eaten by Ammit, a hideous monster, and the person is denied access to the afterlife.",
  "Encyclo/#Military_Title": "Military",
  "Encyclo/#Military_Content": "The Egyptian military evolved over the thousands of years of pharaonic rule. In the Old Kingdom, armies were raised when needed and were usually comprised of nobles and their followers or foreigners. The Old Kingdom had no professional army. The men who served in the army came from different walks of life and presumably returned to their former professions as soon as the fighting was over. \nBy the time of the New Kingdom, however, the structure of the army had changed. The army was clearly divided into units of infantry and charioteers. The infantry could be divided into two parts: soldiers who specialized in close combat and those who specialized in longer range combat. Chariots were used for mobile long-range combat. Soldiers with bows and arrows rode each chariot, firing into the enemy. Naval combat was frequent, although the navy was not seen as a separate and distinct division of the armed forces. The navy was a part of the land forces, and soldiers who served on boats were described using the same terms as those that served on land. Again, foreigners comprised a significant portion of the army. Nubians, Libyans, Levantines and Carians all fought on behalf of the Egyptians. \nThe Egyptian army was organized into battalions in the Old Kingdom. During the New Kingdom, the battalions were further subdivided into divisions, which were named after gods.

Wheat and barley were both turned into flour, then baked into bread. For more on the use of bread made from barley, see <link=\"#Beer_Title\"><u>Beer</u></link>. \nThe Egyptians used three types of wheat: emmer, einkorn and spelt. Wheat was processed into flour through threshing. Stalks of wheat were placed on the ground, and livestock or other large animals were brought in to stomp on the wheat. This pounding released the grain from the sheaves. Then, the grain was separated from the chaff and other impurities either by sifting or by throwing the wheat up in the air. The wind would carry off the lighter chaff, and the heavier wheat would fall to the ground. After the grain was processed, it was taken to the <link=\"#Granary_Title\"><u>granaries</u></link>. At the granaries, the wheat would be processed into flour and stored for future use.  \nTo make bread, a dough was made from flour and poured into ceramic molds of different shapes.

  "Encyclo/#CattleFish_Title": "Cattle Ranching and Fishing",
  "Encyclo/#CattleFish_Content": "Egyptians raised several different animals on ranches or farms to be used for food. The most prevalent of these animals were long-horned cattle. These cattle were tended by herdsmen, who were typically portrayed in tomb scenes as being very lean with unshaven faces. The cattle were sent to pasture to feed. Sometimes, the cattle were sent to fields that had been recently harvested to eat straw and chaff. \nThe Egyptians also raised sheep, goats and pigs on farms, as well as geese and other fowl. Horses were also raised, not for food, but to be used to draw the chariots of the noblest Egyptians. The horse was introduced into Egypt by the Hyksos, one of Egypt's <link=\"#Enemies_Title\"><u>invaders</u></link>. \nFish provided an alternate source of food, though it seems to have been eaten primarily by the lower classes. The Egyptians caught fish in several different ways. Some set out in canoes and used fishing rods with lines and hooks to catch fish one at a time. Traps were also built to catch larger numbers of fish. The most efficient way to catch fish, however, was the drag net. Because the catch would be so great, bringing a drag net back to the surface required two boats of men. \nThere were dangers involved in the fishing profession. One species of catfish had a poisonous spine on its dorsal fin, and there was always the danger of hippopotamuses and crocodiles.

  "Encyclo/#Clay_Title": "Clay",
  "Encyclo/#Clay_Content": "Clay was easily obtained in ancient Egypt, and the quality of clay varied by region. Along the Nile, years of Inundations resulted in rich deposits of mud waiting to be dug up and molded into pottery. In the desert regions, veins of soft marl and shale could be found in limestone. Clay from the desert yielded harder pottery than clay from the Nile and produced objects that had a pink or green hue. \nPottery made from Nile clay tended to be red or black.

  "Encyclo/#Gold_Title": "Gold and Gold Mining",
  "Encyclo/#Gold_Content": "In pharaonic Egypt, particularly during the New Kingdom, gold was primarily mined in Egypt's eastern desert and in Nubia. Mining the gold could be an arduous task. In the eastern desert, for example, veins of gold were interspersed in granite and quartz. The granite was chiseled into powder, then submerged in water to separate the gold from the rock. This process was certainly very time consuming. Nevertheless, gold was relatively plentiful and was, in fact, easier to obtain than silver. \nThe gold ore was chiseled from the bedrock, then processed through grinding mills, then submerged in water. As the gold cooled, it formed into nuggets, which were then taken to goldsmiths for use. Gold was also melted and poured into ring molds to create ring-shaped gold ingots.\nLike almost every other commodity, gold inventory was strictly maintained by scribes. They carefully weighed out gold every morning to the smiths, and their work was carefully supervised to ensure that they weren't stealing any.  \nWhile gold was more plentiful than silver, by no means was there an excessive amount of gold available. As a result, most objects were gold plated instead of being made of solid gold.",

  "Encyclo/#Wood_Content": "Native trees were not plentiful in Egypt. While the soil on the floodplains would be fertile enough to support tree growth, the flood itself would uproot trees before they had a chance to grow. Trees that did manage to grow in Egypt included the sycamore, the persea tree, the date palm and the horseradish tree. Each of these trees was accorded religious significance and viewed as a dwelling place for the gods. \nBecause of their special significance, wood cutters had to receive special permission before cutting trees down. The trees that were cut produced brittle wood that had limited uses. Egypt imported most of its wood from what is now Lebanon, Syria, and Israel. When Egypt eventually conquered these lands during the New Kingdom, they harvested trees with abandon, significantly depleting the tree stock. Ebony wood was also imported from Nubia.\nWood was used for furniture, coffins and in buildings.

Some quarries operated year-round, especially if a large construction project, like a pyramid, was underway. \nTo transport the blocks to their final destination, the blocks were placed on a sled and dragged by a team of workmen. Logs were frequently laid down to act as rollers, facilitating the process. Sometimes, water was poured in front of the sled to ease friction. \nSlaves made up some of the labor force at quarries, although Egyptians still made up the bulk of the labor force.",

  "Encyclo/#Beer_Content": "Beer was the beverage of choice for ancient Egyptians. Debate rages over the particulars of the Egyptian beer industry. How was the beer brewed?  Was the beer flavored with fruit?  Did they make barley or grain beers?  And what about malting?  Research is underway to answer all of these questions. \nBased on pictures found on tomb walls, one beer-making method the Egyptians used involved baking a special loaf of bread. This bread was crushed and placed in a sieve. Then, water was forced through it and the ensuing concoction was bottled and fermented. Most art shows men brewing beer while women ground flour. Some women brewed beer, but it seems to be mainly a male profession. About 17 types of beer have been identified in papyri. \nThe Egyptians drank their beer out of specially designed mugs. The mugs were outfitted with an angled pipe, a little like a straw. At the end of the pipe was a filter, which sifted out any solid material that might be in the beer.

Once the desired width was achieved, more strips of pith were laid on top of the first row at a right angle. Then, a second piece of cloth was placed on top, and the pith was beaten with a heavy piece of wood or a mallet. Beating the pith welded it together.

For close-range fighting, soldiers used any of a number of weapons, including the mace, the dagger, the broad sword and the battle ax. The primary weapon used for longer-range battle was the bow and arrow, although slingshots were evidently used as well. \nEgyptian weaponry evolved over time and took a big step forward after the invasion of the Hyksos. The Hyksos introduced horses and chariots to Egyptian warfare.",
  "Encyclo/#LuxuryGoods_Title": "Luxury Goods",
  "Encyclo/#LuxuryGoods_Content": "Food, drink and clothing were enough for peasants, but the upper classes in ancient Egypt required a retinue of products to maintain their lifestyles. Chief among these luxuries was makeup. Both men and women wore eye makeup, either kohl or malachite. In addition to enhancing appearance, the Egyptians believed that eye makeup protected their vision. Women also used henna for nail polish and occasionally as hair dye. \nCleanliness was important to the ancient Egyptians, and in addition to regular bathing they perfumed themselves with various oils and extracts. Myrrh and frankincense were both used for this purpose. \nRelated to cleanliness was the use of wigs. Most Egyptians kept their hair short, possibly to prevent lice, and adorned their heads with wigs. Wigs came in various styles, and many men and women had more than one. Wigs were generally made from human hair, which was attached to the wig's base with string. Only the wealthy could afford wigs or hair extensions made of real human hair. Poorer people would wear wigs made of animal hair or wool or even plant fiber. \n<link=\"#Jewelry_Title\"><u>Jewelry</u></link> was another popular luxury item for the wealthy.",
  "Encyclo/#Pottery_Title": "Pottery",
  "Encyclo/#Pottery_Content": "It was unlikely that there was a home that did not possess pottery. Pottery manufacture, one of the oldest industries in ancient Egypt, originated in the home, where women produced whatever vessels were needed for cooking. Like other industries in Egypt, pottery making moved from the milieu of the home to the workshop. \nThe first step to making pottery was preparing the <link=\"#Clay_Title\"><u>clay</u></link> for use. The clay had to be kneaded, and often straw or chaff was added to the clay to act as a binding agent. Men kneaded the clay by hand or by foot, stepping on it to make the clay workable. The clay was then placed on a wheel to be shaped. \nThe potter's wheel evolved through time. In its earliest form, the potter turned the wheel with one hand while molding the clay with the other. Because the potter could not turn the wheel very fast, the pottery had to be smoothed by hand later. During the New Kingdom, a second person spun the wheel with both hands while the potter shaped the vessel. This led to a much smoother finished product. By the end of the New Kingdom, the potter was again spinning his own wheel, this time with his feet, which yielded the smoothest pottery yet. \nAfter the vessels were shaped, they were left to dry. The pieces were decorated during the drying process. After drying, they were fired in a kiln. The kiln was a large oven with a fire chamber at its base. The fire chamber was separated from an upper chamber by a clay grid. Pottery was placed on this grid. The top chamber was sealed except for a hole to let smoke out. Once firing was complete, the product was finished and stored until needed.",

  "Encyclo/#Osiris_Content": "Osiris' role in Egyptian religion changed over the millennia. He, along with his wife and sister Isis, another sister Nephthys, and brother Seth, was one of the earliest gods and a member of the Ennead (see <link=\"#Religion_Title\"><u>religion</u></link> for more on the Ennead). \nThe myth that defines Osiris links him with agriculture, the Nile and funerary customs. Ra-Atum gave Osiris rule of ancient Egypt. Osiris married his sister, Isis, and taught the people many things as its ruler, most importantly the art of agriculture. After he schooled the Egyptians, Osiris left Egypt to civilize the rest of the world, leaving Isis in charge. Isis ruled well in his absence, but upon Osiris' return, his brother, Seth, began to plot against him. Seth invited Osiris to a sumptuous feast where he produced a beautiful coffin. He offered the coffin to whomever it best fit. When Osiris climbed in the coffin, Seth shut the lid and threw the coffin into the Nile. \nIsis managed to fish the coffin out of the Nile, but Seth caught her and hacked Osiris to pieces. Isis, distraught, cried, and her tears were believed to be the cause of the Inundation. Eventually, Isis and Nephthys gathered up the scattered pieces of Osiris' body except his genitalia, which had been consumed by the oxyrhynchus fish. Anubis, god of embalming, wrapped Osiris together with linen, in the same way that human bodies were wrapped in the mummification process.. Egyptians were, understandably, banned from eating the oxyrhynchus fish. Eventually, Osiris became the god of the underworld and was the supreme judge who granted or denied entry into the afterlife. \nSebek, the crocodile god, was a fertility god who was worshipped primarily in the Fayuum, although he was known throughout Egypt.

The onset of malaria is marked by fever, which is followed by muscle aches, sweating and fatigue. One of the malaria-causing parasites produces severe cases that can lead to death. \nTo prevent potentially fatal and, at the very least, annoyingly itchy mosquito bites, ancient Egyptians used mosquito netting on their beds.

  "Encyclo/#Hunting_Content": "Compared to the food grown on farms and raised on ranches, hunting contributed little to Egyptian food stock. Still, hunting was enjoyed by the upper class, and many pharaohs bragged about their skills as hunters. Gazelles, antelopes, ibex, oxen, sheep and ostriches were the main targets of hunters, although some hunted hyenas, lions and leopards for sport (and for their hides in the case of leopards and lions). Hunters used bows and arrows, lances, or spears to kill their quarry. \nThe Egyptians were equally fond of hunting water-based animals, including fowl and hippopotamus. Groups of men hunted the hippopotamus together with a harpoon that was attached to a rope. Several men tried to hit the hippopotamus with the harpoons. Once enough damage had been inflicted, the men dragged the hippopotamus to shore using the rope. \nFowl were killed with throwing sticks, which are a little like Australian boomerangs. The hunter's helpers, either family members or servants, collected the felled fowl. Birds were also trapped in nets that were laid down on a field. The net was sprinkled with food for the birds. Once attracted to the spot, the net's corners were pulled together with the birds trapped inside.",
  "Encyclo/#Priests_Title": "Priests",
  "Encyclo/#Priests_Content": "Because ancient Egypt was a theocracy, priests frequently assumed administrative roles within their communities, sometimes dispensing justice. Their role extended far beyond religious duties. \nThe mark of a priest was his cleanliness. The priests underwent purification rites before they could enter the temple and shaved off their hair to ensure they did not harbor lice or other impurities. Depending on which god a priest served, he was prohibited from eating certain types of food. Priests had special clothing. The priests performing mortuary cult rituals adorned themselves with leopard skins. \nThe primary religious concern for the priesthood was the care and feeding of the resident god. Each temple had a statue of its patron god on the premises. Each priest in the temple had his own responsibility to make sure the god was happy. Some of the priests were in charge of making sure the god was well fed. Using food that had been given as an offering by locals or produced on the temple's estate, the priests prepared a meal for the god. The god would partake of the 'essence' of the food, and the priests ate the leftovers. The priests also clothed and bathed the god and provided entertainment. Occasionally, the god would be taken on an outing and paraded through the city (see <link=\"#Festival_Title\"><u>festivals</u></link> for more). \nThe priesthood was divided into distinct classes. The most elite priest was the High Priest, also called the First Prophet, who was appointed by the pharaoh. The High Priest was the ultimate authority within the temple and frequently served as an advisor to the pharaoh. Beneath the High Priest were the Deputy High Priests, or Second Prophets, who oversaw particular functions of the temple or its estate, such as the workshops or the farms.

  "Encyclo/#Scribes_Title": "Scribes",
  "Encyclo/#Scribes_Content": "Scribes, or sesh, permeated Egyptian society and government and were associated with just about every governmental activity. The ancient Egyptians kept records of almost everything, and scribes were the only ones who could perform this function. Scribes recorded how much tax each person owed the government, kept track of exports and imports and also recorded the numbers of dead enemies after battles. For private citizens, scribes drew up legal documents, like wills, and also read and wrote letters for individuals. \nThe tools of the trade for the scribe included papyrus, a palette with two cakes of ink (typically black and red), a pot of water, and reed brushes. The scribe dipped the brush into the water and then rubbed the brush over a cake of ink. He then wrote on the papyrus. \nNot all scribes knew how to write hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs were reserved for monuments and temples. For daily use, a simpler version of hieroglyphic script, called hieratic, was used.  \nThe written language consisted of about 700 signs and combined symbols that represented sounds with symbols that represented ideas. The script mostly omitted vowels, so historians can only speculate on how spoken ancient Egyptian sounded.",

With axes, the carpenter trimmed off any branches from the logs and split the wood if he was making rafters. Saws were used to cut the logs into planks, and adzes to smooth the planks of any bumps. \nFinished products included chests, beds, doors and door frames, chairs and, perhaps most importantly, coffins. Instead of nails, dowels were used to hold finished pieces together. Some of the finished pieces were exquisite, with fine inlays and engravings decorating the surfaces. \nCarpenters were also needed for the construction of larger homes. Ceilings in wealthier houses were frequently supported with finely decorated wooden columns. \nBasic carpentry changed little over ancient Egyptian history, and the same basic tools were favored.

There were many sphinxes in Egypt, but the most famous by far is the Great Sphinx at Giza (Rostja).  \nBuilt around 2500 BC, the Great Sphinx seemingly guards Khafre's pyramid and sits over an old quarry. Its face is thought to be that of Khafre himself. The Sphinx is about 200 feet (60 meters) long and 65 feet (20 meters) tall. It is carved from limestone. \nThe Sphinx, due to natural buildup of sand over time, was buried for most of its existence. Legend has it that Thutmose IV, before he became pharaoh, was hunting in the area of the Sphinx and fell asleep on the spot where it lies. As Thutmose slept, the Sphinx told him in a dream that if he unburied the Sphinx, he would become pharaoh. Thutmose did the Sphinx's bidding and became pharaoh in 1425 BC. He recorded the story on stelae and placed it between the Sphinx's paws. \nAgain, over time, windblown sand built up and the Great Sphinx was again buried. It was re-excavated in the 1930s. Attempts to preserve the Sphinx have met with mixed results.",
  "Encyclo/#Pyramids_Title": "Pyramids",
  "Encyclo/#Pyramids_Content": "People have speculated for centuries on how the pyramids were built. It seems unfathomable that the ancient Egyptians, without the benefit of forklifts, cranes, backhoes and a slew of other modern equipment, could have constructed such magnificent structures. \nThe building of any pyramid started with a well laid-out plan. The vizier, second only to the pharaoh in rank, most likely oversaw the entire process with the royal architect (known as medjeh nesu in ancient Egyptian) specifying the plans. The royal architect was responsible for choosing material and figuring out how to get the material to the site. \nAfter the site was carefully chosen, astronomers determined the north-south axis of the pyramid. Then, surveyors laid out all sides of the pyramid using a special kind of cord that was so thick that it would not stretch and ruin the dimensions of the pyramid. Then, the ground was leveled, perhaps by filling ditches with water to determine a uniform plane. \nOnce these tasks were complete, construction was ready to begin. To kick off construction, a ceremony was held in which the pharaoh marked the corners of the pyramid with stakes, stretched a cord between the stakes, and placed a ceremonial mud brick as the first stone in the monument. \nAt this point, the <link=\"#Stonemason_Title\"><u>stonemasons</u></link> and laborers took over. For pyramids with subterranean chambers, stonemasons carved out the underground rooms, including the burial chamber. Once these were ready, the arduous process of bringing stone blocks, some of which weighed as much as 2.5 tons, began. The stones were hauled on sleds, and ramps were probably used to reach the higher parts of the pyramid. In addition to the rough-hewn stones that made up the interior of the pyramid, finer stone encased the structure. \nPyramids were generally part of larger pyramid complexes. The pyramid complex featured a valley temple that sat on the water or on the edge of the cultivated area. From the valley temple, a long causeway led to the mortuary temple, which was situated on the east side of the pyramid. \nThe form of pyramids evolved as the technology to build them was refined. The first pyramid, Djoser's Step Pyramid, does not have smooth sides. Built around 2620 BC, the Step Pyramid is a series of squares stacked on top of each other. The first true pyramid is Snofru's, built around 2550 BC. An outer casing smoothed the 'steps' of the pyramid, and this practice was soon adopted for other pyramids. The largest pyramid is Khufu's, which measures 252 x 252 yards (230 x 230 meters) and reaches a height of 160 yards (146 meters). One unique pyramid is Snofru's Bent Pyramid. The angle of the sides of the pyramid changes about two-thirds of the way up from the base. The speculation is that architects determined that the pyramid would have been too heavy and prone to collapse if it had continued to be built at its original angle.",
  "Encyclo/#Festival_Title": "Festivals",
  "Encyclo/#Festival_Content": "Ancient Egyptian festivals were joyous celebrations in which food was abundant and beer flowed freely. They celebrated for many different reasons: to honor a god, to mark the harvest and to recognize the longevity of the pharaoh. The last five days of the Egyptian year were spent celebrating, and numerous other festivals occurred throughout the year. \nIt was during festivals in honor of a deity that all people had somewhat more access to state gods than usual. At the center of religious festivals was the procession of the god. During the festival, the statue of the god that resided in the temple, beyond public view, was outfitted in its finest garments and paraded through town on a ceremonial bark borne by priests. The priests rested periodically, during which time rites were performed. During the New Kingdom, citizens could ask the god questions while the priests were resting. The priests bowed if the god responded positively to the question and moved back if the response was negative. At the end of the festival, the god returned to his home in the temple. \nSometimes, the gods travelled quite far and were transported by boat. For example, during the Opet festival, Amun travelled from Karnak to his southern chapel at Luxor. To make the journey, he sailed along the Nile. Opet was one of the most joyous festivals and lasted anywhere from 11-27 days. \nTraditionally, when a king reached his 30th year of rule, he celebrated his heb-sed, or jubilee festival. Then, this was celebrated every three or four years thereafter. Among the arcane rituals performed during this festival, the pharaoh performed a ritual run to prove that he (or she) was still fit to rule. Some pharaohs didn't wait until their 30th regnal year before celebrating their heb-sed and celebrated them much earlier in their reigns.\nUndoubtedly, Egyptians from all walks of life welcomed festivals as a time to eat and drink. Festivals also offered respite from the daily grind.",

Workers used pounders of dolerite to slowly carve out the needed shape. The obelisk at Aswan was abandoned because a fissure developed in the center of the stone. \nOnce the obelisk was hewn from the rock, they were transported by boat on the Nile to their destination.

Then, the thread was attached to spindles, and weaving would begin. \nThe Egyptians used a horizontal loom placed on the floor. The weavers threaded the loom with two parallel rows of thread (the warp). Two workers sat at either side of the loom and sent the threaded shuttle (the weft) back and forth to make cloth. \nDuring the New Kingdom, a vertical loom replaced the horizontal loom.

  "Encyclo/#Religion_Title": "Religion",
  "Encyclo/#Religion_Content": "Egyptian religion featured a well-populated pantheon of major and minor gods. Most cities, and even individuals, viewed a specific god as their patron, and this practice influenced which gods held the most importance. \nOne of the earliest belief structures was the Ennead, or group of nine gods. Founded in the city of On (Heliopolis), the first god in the Ennead is Atum, who linked with Ra to become Ra-Atum. Ra-Atum, though male, managed to single-handedly produce twins, Shu and Tefnut. \nShu was god of the air, and Tefnut was goddess of moisture. Shu and Tefnut had two children: Geb, god of the earth, and Nut, goddess of the sky. Geb and Nut produced four children: Isis, Osiris, Nephthys and Seth. Rounding out the nine gods is Horus, son of Isis and Osiris. This system of gods dominated the religion of pharaonic Egypt. \nAccording to Manetho, a historian who lived during the Ptolemaic Period, when Hor-Aha united Upper and Lower Egypt in the First Dynasty, he founded the capital at Memphis and established the cult of Ptah, a creator god. Manetho wrote that Hor-Aha maintained that the Ennead gods were all manifestations of Ptah. However, Ra remained the predominant god Heliopolis. \nAnother creation myth was founded in the Upper Egyptian city of Khmun (Hermopolis). The Hermopolitans theology consists of the Ogdoad, or group of eight gods. In the Ogdoad, a pair of male and female gods represented different aspects of the cosmos. Nun and Naunent represented the primordial waters, Huh and Hauhet represented unendingness, Kuk and Kauket were gods of primordial darkness, and Amon and Amaunet were gods of inactivity whose names mean \"the hidden one\". \nIn the New Kingdom, Amon unseated Ra as the primary god. Amon's domination continued until the reign of Akhenaten. Akhenaten attempted to introduce a new theology into Egypt, maintaining that the god Aten, who was embodied by the sun's disk, was the primary god. Some scholars have suggested his religion may have been an early format of monotheism, but this is hotly debated. \nDuring his rule, known today as the Amarna period, Akhenaten closed down the temples of other gods. Upon his death, however, traditional religion was quickly reintroduced, and the temples to other gods were reopened.",

  "Encyclo/#Valley_Content": "The Valley of the Kings was the necropolis for five centuries of pharaohs, ca. 1539-1075 BC, including Thutmose I, Tutankhamun and Ramses the Great (Ramses II). Located on the western bank of the Nile across from the temple complex at Thebes, the Valley is overlooked by el-Qurn, a naturally pyramid-shaped mountain that receives the last blessings of Ra each day before the sun sets. Between the Valley and the great Nile are the royal mortuary temples built for individual pharaohs who expected to enjoy their afterlives in the Valley's tombs. \nA nearby village, Deir el-Medina, housed hundreds of workers and their families. Specialized workers prepared the Royal Burial Tombs, and each had an important task to carry out. <link=\"#Stonemason_Title\"><u>Masons</u></link> chiseled steps and passageways into the limestone cliffs. Stone pillars were left to hold up the roofs of large chambers. The hewn rooms were smoothed and plastered before the <link=\"#Artisans_Title\"><u>artisans</u></link> arrived to decorate the ceilings and walls with carved bas-reliefs and paintings that would help guide the pharaoh through his afterlife. \nThe deceased king was placed in his sarcophagus and sealed in the tomb with many burial provisions worthy of the deified status granted him by the ancient Egyptians. Because of these great treasures, the tombs were frequently robbed, sometimes by the very people who were placed to guard them. European archaeologists rediscovered the Valley of the Kings in the early 1800s. In 1922 Howard Carter broke through the sealed tomb of Tutankhamun to find many treasures, including gold coffins and shrines, beds, statues, and other royal furniture. \nOver the centuries, flash floods have filled many of the tombs with silt and debris, and it is a good bet that there are passageways - and maybe even some tombs - as yet undiscovered in the Valley.",
  "Encyclo/#Oil_Title": "Oil",
  "Encyclo/#Oil_Content": "Most oils used by ancient Egyptians were imported from Greece, Cyprus and Phoenicia. Natural oils had many uses, such as fuel for <link=\"#Lamps_Title\"><u>lamps</u></link> and for use in cooking. Oils were extracted from a variety of sources (most of which are still used today), such as sesame, linseeds, olives and natural animal fats.",
  "Encyclo/#Zoo_Title": "Zoo",
  "Encyclo/#Zoo_Content": "Ancient Egyptians were fond of the fun and the unusual, and both could be found in quantity at what we might term a zoo. As Egypt's power and influence spread across several continents, many pharaohs received strange and exotic creatures from rulers of distant lands as gifts or tribute. These animals were presented to the pharaoh, and were then kept in special zoological gardens, which would inevitably be found a short distance from the ruler's palace. Evidently, some zoos of Egypt may have been primarily for public spectacle and secondarily for study. \nAlexandria's Great Library purportedly had both a botanical garden and a zoological yard on its grounds. At a Predynastic cemetery at Hierakonpolis, several exotic animals were given exquisite burials. It is unclear if they formed a zoo or were personal pets, or were part of some larger ritual purpose.",
  "Encyclo/#Alexandria_Title": "Alexandria and its Library",
  "Encyclo/#Alexandria_Content": "From its inception, Alexander the Great hoped that Alexandria, the city at the mouth of the Nile that he founded and helped plan, would become a center of trade and culture for the Mediterranean basin. Less than fifty years after its founding in 331 BC, the booming metropolis had become a sophisticated hub of commerce, due in large part to its famed Great Library. \nSoon after Alexander's unexpected early death in 323 BC, his expansive empire dissolved into three major regions. One of his closest friends and ablest generals, Ptolemy, was at the time the de facto governor of Egypt. He took control of that ancient land, eventually becoming pharaoh (as Ptolemy I Soter) and thus continuing the Greek presence in Egypt begun by Alexander. It was Ptolemy that intercepted Alexander's funerary procession, bound for Macedonia, and brought his mortal remains to Alexandria for internment, though archaeologists have not yet found his tomb. \nBesides personal glory and luxurious living, however, the early Ptolemaic rulers were, to their credit, also interested in bettering the culture of their city and its land. Alexandria, Egypt's new capital, was already the center of commerce for the known world; they wanted it to become the intellectual capital as well. To this end Alexandria's Great Library was conceived and built. The Great Library was mankind's first center of scholastic learning and research. The brilliant minds of antiquity here laid the foundations for the systematic study of astronomy, geography, literature, mathematics, medicine, and physics. \nIt was here that Euclid first defined geometry and Eratosthenes accurately measured the circumference of the earth, arguing that India could be reached by sailing westward from Spain. The Ptolemys devoted much time and energy, and not a small portion of their wealth, to obtaining copies of every important manuscript known to man. To this end a law was passed proclaiming that every caravan and ship entering Alexandria was to be searched - not for contraband, but for articles of learning. Any map or scroll found was turned in to the library so that scribes could copy it. Thus Alexandria's scholarly haven eventually contained over 500,000 systematically cataloged papyri scrolls, including many now-lost masterpieces of art, literature and science, such as classics by Homer, Aristotle, Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripedes. \nBut all was not letters of learning. The legendary library's grounds also boasted of a botanical garden and a museum, as well as a temple to the nine muses (Greek gods and goddesses of the arts and sciences). A short stroll along a garden-lined palisade would take one to a <link=\"#Zoo_Title\"><u>zoo</u></link> thay may have been built there as well, no doubt containing many exotic animals. Many were the ancient scholars that walked its colonnaded passages. \nWhat led to the Great Library's demise is not completely clear. A good portion of its priceless works was evidently destroyed in a fire that occurred when Julius Caesar torched the ships of Cleopatra VII's brother. By the fourth century AD, as Christianity's influence was spreading, most of the remaining manuscripts of the Library were apparently destroyed in an effort to stamp out all relics of paganism and heresy. Of the 123 plays of Sophocles that were known to be in the Great Library, only seven remain today.",
  "Encyclo/#Caesareum_Title": "Caesareum",
  "Encyclo/#Caesareum_Content": "Cleopatra VII began the construction of the Caesareum to honor Julius Caesar. It originally consisted of a small temple or altar in the middle of a sanctuary, and possibly later was intended for the worship of Mark Antony's cult. His suicide, followed shortly thereafter by Cleopatra's death, however, meant that this monument was completed by their rival, Octavian (Augustus Caesar), who completed the structure and dedicated it to his own cult. \nTwo obelisks (commonly referred to as Cleopatra's Needles, even though she had nothing to do with them), for centuries were prominent landmarks along Alexandria's Eastern Harbor shoreline. These obelisks, transported to Alexandria from Heliopolis by order of Octavian, marked the entrance to Caesareum long after the rest of it was destroyed. Both of the obelisks have now been removed (one stands in New York City's Central Park, the other along the banks of the Thames in London). \nPrecise details about the actual structures of the Caesareum are not known. Our knowledge of it comes from brief descriptions by some ancient authors. Its architecture, like the other great monuments of Alexandria, was in the Greek style. It evidently contained a central sanctuary set amidst open-air courts and surrounded by stoas (columned walkways) that probably served as outer 'walls' for the monument. Rooms and porticos set amidst the stoas contained scrolls and could be used for assemblies or quiet study.",
  "Encyclo/#Pharos_Title": "Pharos Lighthouse",
  "Encyclo/#Pharos_Content": "Even though Alexandria's location was ideal for a commercial port, with lots of coastline and a large natural harbor, its points of egress were rife with dangerous sandbars. It was therefore conceived that a tall lighthouse on Pharos island, near the mouth of the harbor, would not only be of benefit to mariners, but (at least if magnificent enough) would also be a wondrous new attraction to boost Alexandria's renown.  \nThe Pharos lighthouse, as it came to be known, was partially constructed largely of Proconnesian white marble, much of it imported from Princes' Islands off the coast of present-day Turkey. It was built in three large tiers:  the base, or lowest tier, was quadrangular; the middle tier was octagonal; the topmost tier was cylindrical. A mammoth spiral stairway leading to the top even allowed pack animals to haul wood to the top to feed the bright fire that burned there.  \nTopping the spectacular structure was (by some accounts) a statue of Poseidon; another account contends it was an image of Zeus - or perhaps a statue of both of them. The construction of Alexandria's Pharos lighthouse was begun by the first Ptolemy (Soter), but wasn't finished until 283 BC during the reign of his son, Ptolemy Philadelphus.  \nBy all accounts it was an incredible sight, more than worthy of being the Seventh Wonder of the ancient world. This monument's ultimate demise was brought about not by the hand of man but by a series of earthquakes that rocked the region.  Its topmost tier tumbled down during a severe quake in 303 AD.  \nHowever it was not until a massive earthquake on August 8th, 1303, that most of the remaining structure came down, to be swallowed up by the surrounding waters. Today a fort, built by the Mamluk sultan Qait Bey, can be seen on Pharos Island where the wondrous lighthouse once stood.",
  "Encyclo/#AbuSimbel_Title": "Abu Simbel",
  "Encyclo/#AbuSimbel_Content": "Ramses the Great (Ramses II) ruled Egypt ca. 1279-1212 BC. This long-lived pharaoh is renowned for the many temples and monuments built during his reign, the grandest of which was Abu Simbel. About 350 miles south of Waset (Thebes), in the province of Nubia, Ramses' stonemasons carved a row of four seated statues of the pharaoh in the pink sandstone cliffs overlooking the Nile valley. Each statue is over 66 feet tall - only the Great Sphinx at Giza is taller. The seated figures flank a tunnel entrance that leads to an inner sanctum dug 160 feet into the cliff. \nThe temple faces east and was designed so that twice a year light from the rising sun penetrates the rear wall of the sanctum, illuminating three smaller statues of Ramses, Amun and Ra. A statue of Ptah is also located in the sanctum, but because he is associated with the underworld, his statue is positioned so that sunlight does not fall upon it. \nReliefs inside the temple also commemorate Ramses' military victories, particularly his battle at Kadesh, which is pictorially represented on five other of his temples. Nearby, a sister temple carved into the cliffs honors the goddess Hathor and Ramses' foremost wife, Queen Nefertari. The whole complex was intended to awe the Nubian subjects and encourage tributes from them. Abu Simbel was completed ca. 1256 BC. Over the millennia sands buried it. \nIn 1817 archaeologist Giovanni Belzoni uncovered the massive monument. Threatened to be covered again in the mid-1960s, this time by waters rising behind the newly constructed Aswan High Dam, Abu Simbel was cut out of the cliff and reconstructed with great precision on higher ground - an engineering feat that would surely have impressed the ancient Egyptians.",
  "Encyclo/#Plagues_Title": "Major Plagues",
  "Encyclo/#Plagues_Content": "According to the Book of Exodus in the Old Testament, in the 13th century BC, during the reigns of Seti I and his son Ramses the Great (Ramses II), the Hebrews in Egypt were enslaved and were forced to work on construction projects. In this story, God appeared to the prophet Moses and promised to help the Hebrews escape to freedom. \nThus guided by God, Moses appealed to the pharaoh Rameses to 'Let my people go,' on ten separate occasions, and Ramses denied the request each time. Each denial brought forth a different plague to afflict the pharaoh and the Egyptians while sparing the enslaved Hebrews. \nFirst, the river turned to blood, killing the fish and making the water unfit to drink. After Pharaoh's second denial, frogs came up from the ponds and rivers to infest the houses of the villages. The seventh plague was a thunderous hailstorm that smote men and beasts in the field and destroyed crops of barley and flax. According to the Book of Exodus, Ramses' eighth denial to let the children of Israel leave Egypt brought forth a swarm of locusts, which darkened the land with their numbers and devoured all the green things that the hail of the previous plague had left. \nRamses relented after the tenth plague killed all the first-born Egyptian children and beasts, though Ramses sent his army in pursuit of the fleeing Hebrews through the Sea of Reeds. Though these plagues are not recorded in contemporary Egyptian records, there are many instances of similar catastrophes occurring throughout history and prehistory. Even as recently as the 20th century AD, hailstorms and locust swarms have plagued mankind.",

Cartpushers bring supplies of clay to Potters from Clay Pits, if the city has them, or from <link=\"#StorageYard_Title\"><u>Storage Yards</u></link>. The Potter stores some extra clay in its yard to keep him working for awhile if clay deliveries are interrupted for some reason. \nPotters also need road access and a nearby source of labor. Potters are at their most productive if they are fully staffed, but will still operate (although at reduced efficiency) when understaffed. If the Potter is turning out pottery, you will see him hard at work.

Pottery is also integral to the construction of <link=\"#RoyalTomb_Title\"><u>Royal Burial Tombs</u></link>.

See <link=\"#Trade_Title\"><u>trade</u></link> for information on how to open trade routes. If your city is trading pottery, be sure to keep citizens' needs in mind. Let your <link=\"#OverseerCommerce_Title\"><u>Overseer of Commerce</u></link> know how much pottery should be stored in Storage Yards for citizens' use, or let your Overseer determine an amount.  People don't want to live too near a noisy, dusty Potter, so it has a negative effect on the desirability of neighboring land. ",
  "Guide/#Bazaar_Title": "Bazaar",
  "Guide/#Bazaar_Content": "Without Bazaars, people will never have access to the food and goods stored in the <link=\"#Granary_Title\"><u>Granaries</u></link> and <link=\"#StorageYard_Title\"><u>Storage Yards</u></link>. Only Bazaars distribute needed supplies to the populace. To function properly, Bazaars need road access and a full staff. The Bazaar will still function if it is understaffed, but at a much reduced efficiency. Each Bazaar employs two buyers, one to purchase food from Granaries, the other to purchase items from Storage Yards. Each buyer is specialized: the Granary buyer cannot procure items from a Storage Yard, and vice versa. Each of these buyers, however, can buy more than one item at a time. \nSo, for example, a Bazaar buyer that goes to the Granary can buy grain and pomegranates. She cannot, however, buy grain and pottery, because pottery is never stored in a Granary. Once a Bazaar buyer finds the items she needs, a string of helpers carries the load back to the Bazaar. \n\nThe Bazaar buyer is a <link=\"#Walkers_Title\"><u>\"destination walker\"</u></link>. She spends her life shuttling between her Bazaar and the city's Granaries and Storage Yards. Her job description exempts her from walking clear across the city to reach supplies, and she won't do business with supply sources outside of her range. If you catch her standing around when there's work to be done, you're probably expecting her to walk too far or deal with too many suppliers. \nThe other Bazaar employee, the Bazaar trader, takes the items that buyers bring back and distributes them to nearby neighborhoods. As the trader passes within two spaces of housing, she supplies each house with whatever it needs if she has the items in stock. The first priority is to replenish the items a house needs to keep from devolving (see the <link=\"#HousingDesirability_Title\"><u>housing & desirability</u></link> entry). When those needs are satisfied, they try to get the next item the house needs to improve. The Bazaar trader, then, is a \"roaming walker\". Her purpose is to wander through nearby blocks and serve her customers, rather than to proceed to some specific destination. \nIf a particular housing section is not receiving goods, watch where the trader walks. She does not follow a set route. Every time she encounters an intersection, she chooses which way to go, and she won't always take the same path. Plan the city's roads carefully, and use <link=\"#Roadblock_Title\"><u>Roadblocks</u></link> to corral Bazaar traders. A Bazaar that has evolved to its more advanced state (shown by one of its tents being replaced by a small building) sends out two \"roaming walkers\" instead of one. \n\nPeople's needs for basic commodities, like food and pottery, must be met before more advanced wants, like beer or linen, are addressed. Bazaar buyers will ignore a Storage Yard brimming with linen if the houses they serve are crying out for pottery. It's very important, then, to maintain steady supplies of a commodity once houses start demanding it. Remember that as houses evolve, they usually hold more people and, so, consume more goods. Sometimes you'll have to add more Bazaars to keep a neighborhood properly stocked. Click on a house to see what its occupants need at any given moment.\nTo help make sure that residents are getting the food and goods they need, build Granaries and Storage Yards near Bazaars. Use the Granary's and Storage Yard's special orders to make sure they have the goods and foods that the Bazaars need. If you want more control over a Bazaar, Click on it to see a list of all the commodities that it can stock. Click on an item to tell the Bazaar whether or not to buy it. While citizens need to live near Bazaars to have access to all the goods they desire, no one wants to live too close to them. They are noisy places, sometimes filled with unsavory characters, and can be smelly too.",

If a delivery man has to walk so far that his employer finishes producing another load of food before he returns with his empty cart, the production facility will sit idle until he comes to take away the food that has piled up there. If all Granaries are full, delivery men will wait around until some space in a Granary opens up, unless you have instructed a <link=\"#StorageYard_Title\"><u>Storage Yard</u></link> to accept the particular food. To manage the flow of foods in the city, give Granaries Special Orders. \nClick on a Granary to get started. All items the Granary can store are listed for you. There you can change the way that the specific Granary handles the food. The choices are: \nFill Granary: To limit how much of a single food a Granary accepts, use the Fill command represented by a colored circle.  You can tell the Granary to Fill 1/4, 1/2 or 3/4 of the Granary. If you do not want to limit the Granary's intake of a particular food, make sure you have a complete green circle. This choice is useful when you want a Granary to store equal amounts of multiple food types.   \nDon't Accept: Use this command to tell a Granary to stop accepting a food altogether.  The Granary will not accept any new shipments of the particular food, but Bazaar buyers and cart pushers from other Granaries will continue to collect the item from the Granary until the stock is completely depleted. Use this option to make delivery men bypass a nearby Granary in favor of one farther away, or to prevent a food that you want to export from being consumed.\nGet: If a Granary is running low on a particular food that you want it to have on hand, use the Get command. The Granary's cart pusher will search for the item in other Granaries or in the city's Storage Yards until he has met the request. You can tell a Granary to get up to 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 or the full capacity of the Granary. This option can enable Granaries far away from the city's food producers to remain stocked. \nEmpty: If you issue this command, the Granary's cart pushers will try to empty the Granary's stock of food, looking for other Granaries or Storage Yards that have been told to accept the item. A Granary told to empty itself will not accept new shipments of the food that it is trying to send elsewhere. Use this order if you have decided to demolish a Granary, or if you want to remove one type of food that it carries. \nAccept All/Accept None: Use this command to quickly shift between a granary accepting everything or refusing everything. The default behavior is accept all, but you can modify it through the gameplay options.\nGranaries are dusty, often verminous, and not at all welcome neighbors.

  "Guide/#StorageYard_Content": "Storage Yards are the repository for all finished goods and excess raw materials.  They also store food if you specifically tell them to do so (see Special Orders, below) and help to trade imported and exported items (see the <link=\"#Trade_Title\"><u>trade</u></link> entry).\nTo operate, Storage Yards need road access and a nearby supply of labor. Storage Yards are most efficient when they are fully staffed. They can operate if understaffed, but they might stop accepting particular commodities. \nEach Storage Yard is divided into eight sections and can store up to eight different items. Each section can accept only one type of item, but more than one section can store the same item. The quantity of each item that can be stored depends upon the item's size. The larger the item, the less of it a Storage Yard can store. For example, one section of a Storage Yard can hold many more pieces of pottery than blocks of stone. \nMany other buildings need easy access to the Storage Yards. <link=\"#Industry_Title\"><u>Industry</u></link> delivers products to the closest Storage Yard, and Bazaar buyers proceed to the nearest Storage Yard for goods their customers need. Storage Yards, in turn, will deliver raw materials and other needed supplies to the closest buildings first. Cart pushers from Storage Yards will grudgingly travel long distances if necessary, but industries could be idle while they are waiting for needed supplies. It's wise to locate Storage Yards near all the facilities that need them. \nClick on a Storage Yard to find out exactly how much of each item the particular Storage Yard has on hand and whether or not it can accept more goods. You can control the influx and outflow of goods with Special Orders. Click on an item to tell the Storage Yard how to handle it. The orders are: \nFill Storage Yard: To limit how much of a single item a Storage Yard accepts, use the Fill command represented by a colored circle. You can tell the Storage Yard to Fill 1/4, 1/2 or 3/4 of the Storage Yard.  If you do not want to limit the Storage Yard's intake of a particular item, make sure you have a complete green circle.

The Storage Yard will not accept any new shipments of the particular item, but Bazaar buyers, trade partners and industries in the city can use the supplies the Storage Yard still has on hand until the stock of the item is completely depleted. Use this option to make delivery men bypass a nearby Storage Yard in favor of one farther away.  Unless you tell them otherwise, Storage Yards do not accept food, thus ensuring that food is delivered to Granaries instead.\nGet: If a Storage Yard is running low on a particular item you would like it to have on hand, use the Get command. The Storage Yard's cart pusher will search for the item in other Storage Yards until he has met the request.  You can tell a Storage Yard to get up to 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 or the full capacity of the Storage Yard with the Fill command. This option can enable outlying Storage Yards to remain stocked. \nEmpty: If you issue this command, the Storage Yard's cart pusher will try to empty the Storage Yard's stock of the particular item, looking for industries or other Storage Yards that can accept the item.  Use this order if you have decided to demolish a yard, or if you want to remove one type of goods that it carries.\nAccept All/Accept None: Use this command to quickly shift between a granary accepting everything or refusing everything.

  "Guide/#WorkCamp_Title": "Work Camp",
  "Guide/#WorkCamp_Content": "Peasants gather at Work Camps to be assigned to work on nearby <link=\"#FoodFarming_Title\"><u>floodplain farms</u></link> or on <link=\"#MonumentConstruction_Title\"><u>monuments</u></link>. During the growing season, most peasants draw farming duty. During the Inundation, everyone works on the city's monument project.  If there's no monument being built, peasant workers have nothing to do but play a lot of senet during the Inundation. If your city has few Work Camps relative to its number of floodplain farms, you will notice a distinct rhythm that's set by the Inundation. \nWork Camps need road access and their own staff. It is best to place Work Camps near farms and monuments so that the peasants don't have far to walk. Indeed, there is a limit to how far they'll trek to reach their back-breaking chore. The more Work Camps the city has, the quicker monuments can be built, because more laborers will be available during the growing season. The number of farms one Work Camp can support depends mostly on proximity.  A fully-staffed Work Camp supplies one peasant worker every week (four per month). This worker walks to the nearest floodplain farm that's awaiting a peasant, where he will toil for six months. When a farm is halfway through its peasant's work period, Work Camp employees notice that the farm will need another peasant if farming is to continue without interruption - remember that the growing season lasts nine months in most regions. \nIf you're using one Work Camp to supply a very large number of farms, some might never receive peasants, and those that do will have trouble keeping peasant workers continuously. You could run a huge number of floodplain farms with only one or two Work Camps, but many farms wouldn't reach their potential, and peasants would only be available to work on the monument during the Inundation. Practically speaking, one Work Camp can support four to six nearby floodplain farms without interruption and still contribute some peasants to the city's monument project. Adding more Work Camps spreads the burden around and frees up more peasants to work on the monument during the growing season.",

  "Guide/#Ratings_Title": "Ratings",
  "Guide/#Ratings_Content": "Ratings are a mark of how good the city is or how well you are doing as a leader. Four different ratings are used to measure the city: Culture, Prosperity, Kingdom and Monument.\n\nCulture: The Culture Rating assesses how much access your citizens have to <link=\"#Entertainment_Title\"><u>entertainment</u></link>, <link=\"#Education_Title\"><u>education</u></link>, <link=\"#Health_Title\"><u>health</u></link> and <link=\"#Religion_Title\"><u>religion</u></link>. \nThe Culture rating measures not only the number of facilities you have, but also the variety of options. To achieve a high Culture rating, be sure to provide citizens with plenty of options. This means easy access to multiple forms of entertainment, health services (except Apothecaries - they have no effect on the Culture rating) and religion. For wealthier citizens, access to both Libraries and Scribal Schools is a must to keep the Culture rating on the rise, but access is not the entire story.  People learn better in quiet, uncrowded facilities, and your Culture rating reflects the quality of education by measuring how many people use each school and Library. \nIt's possible to have enough educational buildings to provide access for every house in the city, and yet still suffer from overcrowding. To earn the highest Culture rating, see if you can build a <link=\"#Zoo_Title\"><u>Zoo</u></link>. You'll need to build a Zoo if you need to attain a Culture rating higher than 75.\n\nProsperity: The Prosperity rating measures a city's wealth and its financial security. The rating goes far beyond an assessment of the city's treasury: it also looks at the wealth of its citizens, taking into account the value of their property and the unemployment level. If the city earns a profit every year, its Prosperity rating should continue to rise if nothing else in the city is holding the rating back. High unemployment, low-level housing and low wages will stunt the rating's growth. If a Temple Complex or Senet House is functioning in the city, its Prosperity rating rises, because people feel like the city is well-off if it has such glorious structures in it. Finishing a monument also gives the Prosperity rating a boost. \nWhen the city ends the year in debt or loses money, the Prosperity rating suffers. However, if the city lost money because of construction costs, its Prosperity rating isn't affected, because expenditures on construction improve the city.\n\nKingdom: The Kingdom rating represents your reputation, especially with the rest of Egypt. Quick response to an ally's request for help can increase the rating. Failure to comply with requests will hurt the Kingdom rating. If the Kingdom rating falls too low, your shoddy reputation might provoke an attack by Pharaoh or by a neighboring city. You'll usually begin each mission with a rating of 50, which indicates neutrality. People outside your city have barely even heard of you, and those who do know your name and history have few opinions about you. Over time, if you do nothing to improve it, your Kingdom rating gradually falls as word goes out that you are of little importance beyond your city's borders. The rating falls more dramatically if you lose or ignore distant battles, fail to comply with requests for goods or other demands from the rest of the Kingdom, and remain in <link=\"#Money_Title\"><u>debt</u></link> for any length of time. Drawing a salary beyond the standard for your rank doesn't help matters, either. \nTo raise your Kingdom rating, fulfill requests from Pharaoh or other Egyptian cities promptly, especially when they ask for military aid. Victory in battle can do wonders for your reputation. Sometimes even losing a battle might help a little bit, since you at least tried to rescue your countrymen in their hour of need. For a quick pick-me-up in your reputation, use your family savings to buy a gift for Egypt. Your Political Overseer sends the gift of your choice to Pharaoh, or to other Egyptian leaders, or to the people of Egypt - wherever he feels that it will do the most good. Your Kingdom rating will rise by a few points immediately. Resist the temptation to spend all of your savings on gifts, though. They lose their effectiveness if they become too frequent, and the recipients will come to expect them. Eventually, your rating might even decline if you stop sending gifts or send cheaper gifts than the recipients have grown to expect. \nExceeding one gift per year is of questionable effectiveness, and could even be counterproductive. Your Kingdom rating's natural tendency to decline lessens a bit if you draw a personal salary below that defined for your rank.  Drawing no salary at all is even better for your reputation as a selfless public servant - although it isn't the best strategy for building up your family's wealth!\n\nMonument The Monument rating comes from both the size and scope of any monuments in the city, as well as how far along they are in construction.  If you complete all the monuments required and remember to dispatch any necessary burial provisions to provide for the deceased's afterlife, you will have no problem meeting the Monument Rating goal.\n\nA visit to your <link=\"#OverseerRatings_Title\"><u>Ratings Overseer</u></link> will show you your current standing.

Archers craft their own bows and arrows, so you can build Archer Forts even if your city lacks a Weaponsmith.

As the city becomes more established, it needs to provide more amenities to attract new immigrants and keep the inhabitants it has. The best way to keep residents from emigrating is to keep them in a good mood, resulting in high City Sentiment.\n\nCity Sentiment takes several parameters into account, the most important being:\n- Taxation, if you decide to go over the recommended 9% tax rate, your City Sentiment will suffer. Only go over if you can compensate for it. On the flip side, lowering tax will increase the City Sentiment.\n- Wages, if you happen to pay your workers lower than what the rest of Egypt does, it will hurt your City Sentiment. Paying higher than Egypt will help, up to a point.\n- Employment, while missing workers doesn’t have an impact (people tend to immigrate when jobs are available), a high unemployment rate will definitely hurt City Sentiment. Try to keep it contained to 10% so it doesn’t have any negative effect.\n- Slums, once you attract a higher class of citizens in your city (starting with common manors), people living in crude and sturdy huts will be less happy and this will hurt your city sentiment. Evolving these low level houses quickly will normalize the situation.\n\nFailure to meet citizens' needs can cause a wave of emigration. Emigration can sometimes be the start of a vicious circle: emigrants leave because of lack of services, but in leaving they cause a worker shortage. This worker shortage causes even more services to suffer.\nYou should avoid at all costs making conditions so bad in the city that people leave en masse. Your population can also grow and shrink as a result of births and deaths. Check in with your <link=\"#OverseerGranaries_Title\"><u>Overseer of the Granaries</u></link> often to monitor the average age of the city's population. Once workers reach a certain age, they retire, and a worker shortage could happen quite suddenly if a large portion of your population reaches retirement age. If you notice your populace aging, take steps to attract new immigrants, who are usually younger. In addition to encouraging emigration, poor City Sentiment also encourages <link=\"#Crime_Title\"><u>crime</u></link>. \nIf you need a quick fix to poor City Sentiment, throw a lavish or grand <link=\"#OverseerTemple_Title\"><u>festival</u></link>.

If you don't feel confortable with this system, you can go in the options and change it to a global labor pool, removing the need for the buildings to send out an agent.\nWhile workers don't complain much about their lot in life (okay, they complain plenty), they do have goals and aspirations.

  "Guide/#Walkers_Title": "Walkers",
  "Guide/#Walkers_Content": "Virtually all of the people walking your city's streets have some purpose to their travels. Some move commodities from one place to another. Others provide services to homes or other buildings that they pass. Still others are just arriving at or departing from your city. Only a very few elite people have the luxury of free time to walk about with no errand in mind. These walkers can be divided into two basic types: destination walkers and roaming walkers. Each behaves quite differently.\n \nDestination Walkers: Destination walkers leave their places of employment with a specific goal in mind. Using a map of your city's roads, they determine the shortest route to their destination. Examples of destination walkers include Bazaar buyers, emigrants, immigrants and delivery men.\n \nRoaming Walkers: Walkers who roam the city bring benefits to your citizens when they pass within two spaces of housing. Some also provide valuable services to the buildings in the city. Roamers leave their buildings with no specific destination in mind. They try to set off in a different direction every time. From there, they can be completely unpredictable. Every time walkers who roam the city encounter an intersection, they must decide which way to turn. They don't make the same decision every time, so houses that they have passed before may not be visited again for some time. The best way to corral these walkers is through good city planning. Since intersections give these walkers so much freedom, keeping intersections to a minimum helps to guide them to where you want them to go. \n \n<link=\"#Roadblock_Title\"><u>Roadblocks</u></link> are another effective tool in controlling roamers. When a roamer encounters a Roadblock, he or she turns around. Destination walkers ignore Roadblocks. Examples of roaming walkers include Bazaar sellers, water carriers, priests and physicians. Some roaming walkers behave like destination walkers under certain circumstances. For example, fire marshals on their way to douse a fire behave as destination walkers. At all other times, though, they are roaming walkers.\n \nRoaming walkers have a limited workday. Their patrols last for a certain amount of time, after which they leave the streets for a while. If their employer has its full complement of workers, it sends another roamer out almost immediately. If the building is short of employees, there is usually a delay in supplying a new roamer. Destination walkers have to work until their errand is complete, even if that means walking all the way across town and back. Finally, note that the embankment separating a flood plain from dry land is steep, muddy and treacherous. No one can move to or from the flood plain unless a <link=\"#Roads_Title\"><u>road</u></link> makes this boundary passable. \n \nNot everything that walks around the city is friendly. Dangerous animals also prowl the city and its environs, heartlessly killing anyone who might cross their paths. Constables will try their best to kill these beasts. Animals you should watch out for are hyenas, hippos, crocodiles, asps, scorpions and lions.",
  "Guide/#Employment_Title": "Employment and Unemployment",
  "Guide/#Employment_Content": "Nearly every building in the city needs workers. The city cannot provide for its citizens without a labor force. When you first construct a building that needs labor, a recruitment agent patrols the streets looking for willing workers. If he passes some housing nearby, and if the city overall has any available workers, then his quest is successful and the building that sent him will have employees. You can turn off this system in the options, and opt for a global worker pool that every building can directly access as long as they also have access to a road. \nThe labor seeker's job is not always easy. One of the greatest challenges as leader of a city is balancing the work force with the number of jobs available. In a perfect world, a city would have exactly the same number of jobs as people who want them. This hardly ever happens. A city will either have too many workers and not enough jobs, or too many jobs and not enough workers. Unemployment is not good for the city. While the unemployed workers are idle, they may become disenchanted and bring the <link=\"#PopulationGrowth_Title\"><u>sentiment</u></link> of the city down. They could even turn to <link=\"#Crime_Title\"><u>crime</u></link>. \nThe best way to deal with unemployment is to create new jobs. Generally, it doesn't hurt a city to have extra goods and services. A few extra farms, more entertainment facilities, and new Schools, Libraries or Temples can benefit the city. While reducing unemployment, you could increase the city's Prosperity and Culture ratings. Another - albeit heartless - way to reduce unemployment is to reduce the city's population. You can do this by destroying people's homes, forcing emigration. This, too, can have a positive effect on the city. If you destroy lower level housing, the overall value of the city's housing stock will increase. This increase could result in a higher Prosperity rating. \nThe other employment problem you will face is the labor shortage, or having too many jobs for the available workforce. The ideal solution to a labor shortage is to attract new immigrants. Build new housing areas or encourage existing areas to evolve into larger structures. Make sure that <link=\"#PopulationGrowth_Title\"><u>City Sentiment</u></link> is high, too. Paying more than the prevailing wage in Egypt or lowering the city's tax rate can also attract new immigrants.

Talk to your Overseer of the Workers about setting labor priorities.

You'll damage the city's Prosperity rating and decrease its tax revenues, but the labor force will increase - at the cost of your wealthiest citizens' hopes and dreams! Although being out of work is quite stressful for the jobless, a small amount of unemployment is actually a good thing for an expanding city, because it gives you a willing labor pool for new buildings. Unemployment in excess of 10 percent may cause problems.",

  "Guide/#FoodFarming_Title": "Food and Farming",
  "Guide/#FoodFarming_Content": "The way to citizens' hearts is through their stomachs. Providing plenty of food - and a good variety - bolsters both <link=\"#PopulationGrowth_Title\"><u>City Sentiment</u></link> and <link=\"#Health_Title\"><u>City Health</u></link>.  There are many types of food farms in Pharaoh, including <link=\"#GrainFarm_Title\"><u>grain</u></link>, <link=\"#Fruit_Title\"><u>pomegranate</u></link>, <link=\"#Fruit_Title\"><u>chickpea</u></link>, <link=\"#Fruit_Title\"><u>lettuce</u></link> and <link=\"#Fruit_Title\"><u>figs</u></link>. \nThere are also two types of farming in Pharaoh: floodplain farming and meadow farming. Both types of farms require road access and labor, but most similarities end there. Farming isn't the only source of food, either. <link=\"#HuntingLodge_Title\"><u>Hunting</u></link>, <link=\"#FishingWharf_Title\"><u>fishing</u></link> and <link=\"#CattleRanch_Title\"><u>cattle ranching</u></link> all contribute to the city's Granaries.\n\nFloodplain Farming: To understand how floodplain farms work, you must first understand the Nile's stages. Every year, usually between June and September, the Nile floods its banks. The flood plains are completely submerged, and nothing can be placed on the land. In a few months, the Nile begins to recede, leaving nutritious silt behind that fertilizes the soil. The flood plain reemerges, and you can again operate farms on the flood plain. The Nile does not flood at exactly the same time or in exactly the same way every year. Some floods are better than others. \nPriests use Nilometers to determine how good the next flood will be and report their findings to your <link=\"#ChiefOverseer_Title\"><u>Chief Overseer</u></link>. Paying special attention to Osiris, God of Agriculture and the Nile Flood <link=\"#Religion_Title\"><u>(see Religion)</u></link>, can help ensure successful floods every year. You can build farms (and roads, and Irrigation Ditches) on the flood plain at any time except during the flood. When you build a floodplain farm, only the field appears, with no buildings, because the flood destroys any buildings on the floodplain. Since they can't build homes on the floodplain farms, peasants need a place to meet to be assigned to work. <link=\"#WorkCamp_Title\"><u>Work Camps</u></link> serve this function. Work Camps dispatch workers to the farms to plant and reap the crops, and farms lie idle unless there is a Work Camp. \nThere's a limit to how far peasants will walk to reach their back-breaking assignments, so don't put Work Camps too far from the fields. The best time to build farms is soon after the flood recedes. You'll be able to take full advantage of the growing season until the next flood, and the farm will have maximum yield. Farms placed at any other time will produce less. The other factor to consider when placing farms is fertility. The darker the land, the more fertile the land is. The most fertile land is usually found directly adjacent to the river. As you move away from the river, the land becomes less fertile. Farms placed on the most fertile land produce the highest yields. \nYou can build Irrigation Ditches on flood plains to irrigate the land farthest from the river, thereby improving the fertility of land which might be left high and dry during a poor Inundation. Due to the annual rhythm of the Nile, floodplain farms can produce only one crop each year. A city's survival can depend on having enough workers to harvest the crop, and enough storage space to accept the harvest.\n\nMeadow Farming: Floodplain land is not the only fertile land, although it forms the bulk of available arable land. Farms can also be placed on meadows, denoted by yellow tufts. The denser these tufts are, the more fertile the land is, resulting in larger yields. These farms do have a work building on site, so they do not need peasants from a Work Camp. Because the land is not flooded, these farms continue to work throughout the year. However, acre for acre, meadow land is less fertile than floodplain land, and farms on the meadow tend to yield fewer crops per harvest.  Meadow farms almost always benefit from Irrigation Ditches.\n\nHunting and Fishing: Hunters and fishermen take advantage of Egypt's natural abundance. Both set out from their bases, capture their prey, and return back to their bases to prepare the food. Hunters work out of Hunting Lodges. From the Lodge, they set out for the hunt. Hunters will look for flocks of ostriches, waterfowl, or a herd of antelope. If you notice any of these animals around the city, place a Hunting Lodge nearby. Fishermen gather at Fishing Wharves where they swap stories about the one that got away. Wharves, of course, are located on the water, and fishermen need a Shipwright to build them a boat. Once they have a boat, they'll set out. Not every city can support hunting or fishing. If you notice fish jumping out of the water, the city can have a fishing industry.   Herd, flock and school sizes are limited.  Hunting and fishing can provide a small population with enough food, but a large population will not be able to subsist solely on fish or game meat.\n\nCattle Ranching Cattle Ranches can be an excellent source of additional food. They can be placed on any type of land - not just fertile land - which saves arable land for another purpose.  Cattle consume straw, the by-product of <link=\"#GrainFarm_Title\"><u>grain farming</u></link>. The number of cattle ranches a city can have is limited only by the amount of straw the city can devote to cattle feed.\n\nFood Distribution: <link=\"#Granary_Title\"><u>Granaries</u></link> and <link=\"#Bazaar_Title\"><u>Bazaars</u></link> are the intermediaries between food producers and the city's inhabitants. Granaries store the food intended for consumption by people, and Bazaars distribute it to individual homes. Once a food producer has an item ready, a cartpusher brings the food to a Granary. Bazaar buyers go to the Granaries to procure the food their customers are asking for. They can carry more than one type of food at a time. After the buyers return to the Bazaar with their items, Bazaar traders walk through the neighborhood, delivering food to the populace. \nIt's important to have enough Granaries and Bazaars. If all Granaries are full, the cartpusher takes the food to a <link=\"#StorageYard_Title\"><u>Storage Yard</u></link>, if it has been instructed to accept food. Bazaar buyers won't procure locally-produced food from Storage Yards (although they will take non-food items and imported foods there). Bazaar buyers get most food from Granaries. Placing Bazaars and Granaries can be tricky. Granaries should be close to the food producers so that cartpushers don't have far to travel.  \nBazaars should be close to Granaries so the Bazaar buyers can keep their Bazaars well-stocked. Bazaars also need proximity to the houses they will serve.  All of these structures make for undesirable neighbors, so siting them always involves tradeoffs.   As your city grows, you might have to build Granaries further away from the food producers to ensure that Bazaars in outlying neighborhoods can procure the food they need. If you find that you need to do this, use the Granary's Special Orders to make sure it receives food.\n\nImporting Food: Some cities cannot produce enough food to sustain themselves, or can produce only limited varieties of food, and so need to import food from other cities. Imported food is delivered to Storage Yards, where Bazaar buyers can pick up the foodstuffs and bring it back to the Bazaar.",
  "Guide/#Industry_Title": "Industry",
  "Guide/#Industry_Content": "Industry is likely one of the biggest employment sectors in the city. Citizens use some of the products industries produce to enhance their lives. Other products can be <link=\"#Trade_Title\"><u>traded</u></link> for a tidy profit. While a city likely has a myriad of industries, all share certain characteristics. They all need a labor force, and efficiency is compromised if a particular manufacturer or raw material producer is understaffed. All industries need road access, too, so that workers can get to them. Some industries produce a raw material that can be processed into a finished good at a manufacturer. \nThese industries are <link=\"#ClayPit_Title\"><u>Clay Pits</u></link>, <link=\"#GemstoneMine_Title\"><u>Gemstone Mines</u></link>, <link=\"#GoldMine_Title\"><u>Copper Mines</u></link>, <link=\"#WoodCutter_Title\"><u>Wood Cutters</u></link> and <link=\"#WoodCutter_Title\"><u>Reed Gatherers</u></link>. <link=\"#Barley_Title\"><u>Barley Farms</u></link>, <link=\"#_BarleyTitle\"><u>Henna Farms</u></link> and <link=\"#Barley_Title\"><u>Flax Farms</u></link> also produce a raw material for industry. <link=\"#GrainFarm_Title\"><u>Grain Farms</u></link>, in addition to producing food, also produce a non-food item, straw. One raw material producer usually generates enough to support two finished goods industries. Raw materials can be traded, but they do not fetch as high a price as a finished product.\n\nIndustries that transform raw materials into another product (sometimes referred to as 'workshops') are <link=\"#Brewery_Title\"><u>Breweries</u></link>, <link=\"#Jeweler_Title\"><u>Jewelers</u></link>, <link=\"#Weaver_Title\"><u>Weavers</u></link>, <link=\"#PapyrusMaker_Title\"><u>Papyrus Makers</u></link>, <link=\"#Potter_Title\"><u>Potters</u></link>, <link=\"#Brickworks_Title\"><u>Brickworks</u></link>, <link=\"#LampMaker_Title\"><u>Lamp Makers</u></link>, <link=\"#PaintMaker_Title\"><u>Paint Makers</u></link>, <link=\"#Weaponsmith_Title\"><u>Weaponsmiths</u></link>, <link=\"#Weaponsmith_Title\"><u>Shield Makers</u></link>, <link=\"#Weaponsmith_Title\"><u>Bowyers</u></link> and <link=\"#Weaponsmith_Title\"><u>Chariot Makers</u></link>. Their finished products can be used by the city or traded on the open market. \n<link=\"#StoneQuarries_Title\"><u>Quarries</u></link> and <link=\"#GoldMine_Title\"><u>Gold Mines</u></link> are different from other industries, because their raw material is also their finished product. <link=\"#Shipwright_Title\"><u>Shipwrights</u></link> produce a finished product (ships) from a raw material (wood and sometimes copper), but ships cannot be traded on the open market. \n\nDelivery men bring goods where they need to go. Delivery men employed by raw material producers always try first to bring their loads to workshops that needs the material, favoring the nearest location. If no industries require the raw material, the delivery man proceeds to the closest <link=\"#StorageYard_Title\"><u>Storage Yard</u></link> that has room for his goods. If no Storage Yards are available, the delivery man takes a break until space opens up. The only raw material delivery men who do not behave in this fashion are the Gold Mine cart pusher and the quarry sled puller.  The Gold Mine cart pusher brings his gold only to the Palace, never to a Storage Yard. \nBecause stone cannot be manufactured into any other good, quarry sled pullers always bring their materials to a Storage Yard. \n\nSome city buildings need industrial goods to fully function.

A delivery man from a manufacturer tries to bring his finished goods to one of these buildings that needs it. If none are available, he, too, brings his finished product to a Storage Yard, or stands idly by until space opens up. Cartpushers like these impromptu holidays, because they still draw wages and rations while standing about doing nothing. \nClicking on a building shows the building's current production status.

  "Guide/#Trade_Title": "Trade",
  "Guide/#Trade_Content": "No city is completely self-sufficient. Trade brings products to your city that it cannot produce itself. Exporting goods brings in a lot of money - often more than the city can earn from taxes. Because of its importance, your city should begin trading as soon as it can meet the basic needs of its inhabitants. The <link=\"#Worldmap_Title\"><u>World Map</u></link> shows which cities will trade with you. Click on one of these cities to find out which products the municipality buys and sells. Click on the 'Open Trade Route' button to spend the funds to establish the new partnership. \nOpening a trade route can be costly, but it pays off in the long run. Once you open a trade route, visit your <link=\"#OverseerCommerce_Title\"><u>Overseer of Commerce</u></link> to set up the interactions. You'll notice that products sell for less money than they cost you to buy. The difference in the prices covers the merchant's expenses in coming to your city.\n \nImporting: To import a good, click on the commodity you want. After you select an item, you have two choices. You can decide for yourself how much of the item you would like the city to have on hand and instruct your Overseer of Commerce to behave accordingly. Or, you can let your Overseer of Commerce decide how much the city should have on hand. Your Overseer of Commerce will continue to import the item as long as the city's stocks are under the prescribed level, or until the trade partner's annual trade limit has been reached. Some goods your city needs can only be imported. \nThese include white marble for monument construction and oil for <link=\"#LampMaker_Title\"><u>lamps</u></link>. To evolve the city's <link=\"#HousingDesirability_Title\"><u>housing</u></link> to its highest level, you will also have to import luxury goods. Imports can become quite expensive, so monitor the city's <link=\"#_Title\"><u></u></link> carefully. If you notice that the Storage Yards are full of a particular good the city is importing, save money by not importing the good until stocks are depleted. Also, importing raw materials is cheaper than importing finished products. In the long run, the city will save money if it has its own manufacturers to turn an imported raw material into a finished product. \n \nExporting: To export a good, click on the item you wish to export. Then, decide for yourself how much the city should have on hand or let the Overseer of Commerce make the decision. Surpluses will be exported up to the customer's annual quota. Keep in mind that some commodities the city exports are also desired by its citizens, so make sure you keep enough in storage for citizens' needs. Check in with your Bazaars and your citizens' housing frequently to see if they have a supply of the good you are trading. Also, make sure that the buildings that need finished goods have a supply on hand. If housing and other buildings are having difficulty getting an item, the city is probably exporting too much.\n \nSometimes a city can either export or import the same commodity. This gives you more flexibility as you plan the city's industries. If you want to bolster a city's income, dedicate labor to produce the commodity and export it to a trade partner. If you want to use the city's labor force for another purpose, then import the product instead. The city can never simultaneously import and export an item, and it won't benefit from importing the product from one city just to sell it to another. Buyers pay more than sellers receive, so the city will only lose money if it acts as a middleman. On the other hand, importing a raw material and exporting its finished good is often a very profitable proposition. \nMerchants approach your city either by caravan or trade ship. Before you can trade with either type of merchant, you must have a working Storage Yard. In addition to a Storage Yard, you also need a <link=\"#Dock_Title\"><u>Dock</u></link> if you are to engage in trade with merchant barges. Trade ships conduct all their business at Docks, and when they arrive cart pushers from the Docks will retrieve needed items from the Storage Yards.",
  "Guide/#Money_Title": "Money",
  "Guide/#Money_Content": "You can't build a city without money, and the amount of money in its coffers is a good indicator of the city's success. The city earns money by imposing taxes, exporting commodities, receiving gifts and, if available to the city, by mining gold. These comparatively obvious topics are explained toward the end of this entry.  First, though, you should know the finer points of money management.\n\nDebt: The first time your treasury runs dry, other Egyptian leaders might deliver a bail-out gift of additional debens. This doesn't penalize you in any way, and they don't expect repayment. Consider it a warning, though, that your city needs to change its free-spending ways. If you spend all of your rescue funds, or if you don't receive such a gift, your treasury can accrue up to 5,000 debens in debt. Very brief, sporadic forays into debt are often unavoidable, and these will not harm you if you quickly restore a positive balance to your accounts. Long-term indebtedness can cost you the game.\n\nConsequences of Debt: Every month that your treasury has a deficit costs you an interest payment, which is automatically added to your debt total. The greater your indebtedness, the more interest you have to pay, and the larger your debt grows. If you don't achieve a positive treasury balance (however briefly) for 12 months after first incurring debt, your Kingdom rating suffers as other Egyptian leaders lose confidence in your ability to govern. Your first 'debt anniversary' penalty, while painful, probably won't cause irreparable harm. If you have still not seen positive numbers on your second debt anniversary, your Kingdom rating drops substantially, and subsequent years will be even worse.\n\nGetting Out of Debt: Debt is clearly a serious problem, and when you can't avoid it, you need to retire your debt as quickly as possible. Ways to raise money are discussed below, but you should also refrain from spending any of your limited credit on anything that will not ultimately earn you money.  Tax Collector's offices, industries that make exportable commodities and new trade routes with cities that will buy your products could all be wise expenditures.\n\nTaxes: Taxes charge citizens for all the services the city provides them. Citizens won't grumble about paying taxes as long as the tax rate is reasonable. The initial tax rate of 9 percent is a good benchmark, but you can raise or lower the rate at any time. Visit your Overseer of the Treasury or Click on the Palace to adjust the rate. Lowering the tax rate buys you joy and appreciation. Raising the tax rate prompts complaints, and could lead to a mass exodus of citizens from the city. Raising the tax rate may be necessary sometimes. If you notice that your city is about to go into debt, you can raise the tax rate to alleviate the problem. You should probably find an alternate long-term solution to your city's money problems, though. A high tax rate can quickly worsen <link=\"#PopulationGrowth_Title\"><u>City Sentiment</u></link>. \nWhile citizens don't mind paying taxes, they won't volunteer a portion of their income without being asked. To collect taxes, the city must have a <link=\"#Palace_Title\"><u>Palace</u></link>. Then, build <link=\"#TaxCollector_Title\"><u>Tax Collectors' offices</u></link> to actually collect the tax. The Overseer of the Treasury knows what percentage of your population is registered for the tax, and how much tax income was not collected because of a lack of tax collectors. Also, make sure that you levy taxes in the city fairly.  If a portion of the city's inhabitants is paying a high tax rate and the other portion is not paying any at all, <link=\"#PopulationGrowth_Title\"><u>City Sentiment</u></link> will plunge, and <link=\"#Crime_Title\"><u></u>crime</link> could break out.\n\nTrade: Money from exports will likely be the city's main source of income. Open up trade routes as soon as possible. It's crucial that you understand how to export commodities, so be sure to read up on <link=\"#Trade_Title\"><u>trade</u></link> if this gives you problems.\n\nMining Gold: Some cities can manufacture their own money. Gold is converted into debens, the basic currency in Egypt. If you see metal nuggets embedded in an outcropping of rock, then you might be able to build a <link=\"#GoldMine_Title\"><u>Gold Mine</u></link>. Don't get too excited; the ore might turn out to be <link=\"#GoldMine_Title\"><u>copper</u></link>, which is quite valuable in its own right but usually not as welcome as gold. Gold Mines function like other <link=\"#Industry_Title\"><u>industries</u></link>, but their output is delivered only to the Palace, where it is turned into debens, and never to a Storage Yard.\n\nFamily Savings and Salary: Like the city, you, too, can earn money. You are paid for your efforts as city leader and can draw a wage as soon as you build yourself a <link=\"#Mansion_Title\"><u>Mansion</u></link>. Your salary is paid to you from the city's treasury, and your wage is commensurate with your experience. You can choose to alter your wage, but if you pay yourself too much more than you are worth, your <link=\"#Ratings_Title\"><u>Kingdom Rating</u></link> could tumble. You can also pay yourself less money, or not pay yourself at all, which can impress people and help your Kingdom rating. If your city is having financial difficulties, not paying yourself a salary is a good way to cut costs. You can transfer family savings to the city treasury at any time - a good way to erase or prevent debt. \nYou can never transfer treasury money to your family account, though. That would be embezzling! Your family savings can also purchase a \"gift for Egypt\". Such donations to the people of Egypt, or, at your Overseer's discretion, to other Egyptian leaders will immediately improve your Kingdom rating by a small amount. Be careful with this stratagem, though. Once the gifts begin, their recipients come to expect them, especially if you have been handing them out on a regular basis. Cutting them off can actually harm your rating.",

Appeasing these gods pays dividends, and ignoring them causes the grief. Your <link=\"#OverseerTemple_Title\"><u>Overseer of the Temples</u></link> knows the mood of the gods, so check in with him often. Many cities have a patron god. The patron god expects more from a city than the other, local deities. Local deities demand less than a patron god, but can impact the city, for good or for ill, just the same.

  "Guide/#Health_Content": "Poor city health can discourage immigrants from coming to your city, and could even cause some of the city's residents to die. Take steps to ensure that your citizens feel fit. A number of health disasters could befall your citizens if you do not take precautions. To keep your citizens healthy, make sure they have access to plenty of food and to a <link=\"#Physician_Title\"><u>Physician's office</u></link>. The more types of food your citizens eat, the healthier they feel. Access to <link=\"#Mortuary_Title\"><u>Mortuaries</u></link> also improves overall city health. \nClean drinking water from a <link=\"#WaterSupply_Title\"><u>Water Supply</u></link> and access to an <link=\"#Apothecary_Title\"><u>Apothecary</u></link> helps to reduce the risk of malaria. Overall city health is determined by the health of each of its citizens, so be sure to provide adequate access to healthcare to all inhabitants of the city. Along with malaria, disease and the dreaded plague stalk the city. With careful planning and an ever watchful eye on citizens' health, these health problems can be avoided.\n\nDisease: Disease occurs in homes that are not visited by a physician frequently and do not have a steady supply of food. Disease strikes homes individually and does not spread.  However, if an entire neighborhood has particularly poor access to physicians and to food, then more than one house could become diseased. Build more Physician's offices in these areas, and make sure <link=\"#Bazaar_Title\"><u>Bazaars</u></link> are supplying the houses with food.\n\nMalaria: Malaria is one of the risks of living near the water. Homes close to the river and to reed-filled marshes are most at risk. Like disease, malaria strikes individual homes. The illness, however, will spread to neighboring homes. To combat the risk of malaria, build plenty of Apothecaries in at-risk areas, and make sure that houses in these areas receive water from a Water Supply.\n\nPlague: Outbreaks of plague occur when overall city health is low, regardless of the health of particular homes. The only thing you can do to avoid plagues is to make sure you keep the city healthy overall. By the way, don't confuse plague with <link=\"#MajorPlagues_Title\"><u>Major Plagues</u></link>. Major Plagues are caused by factors beyond your control, not by city health. \nWhen plague does break out, it begins in one house. One of the delirious, plague-stricken individuals in the house wanders the streets, infecting each house he passes. In a month's time, he'll succumb to the illness. An herbalist from an Apothecary will promptly remove any plagued citizen he encounters. No overlays can show you which house will host the first plague victim, because plague is unrelated to conditions in any particular home or neighborhood. \n\nIf a house becomes infected with any of the above ailments, all the people in the house die. The house remains infected for two months, during which time no immigrants or vagrants will move in. After two months, the housing is cleansed and livable again. All of the goods its previous inhabitants owned are still there. While classified as a health building, the Dentists' office contribute to an area's property value and have no effect on city-wide health. \nYour <link=\"#OverseerHealth_Title\"><u>Overseer of Public Health</u></link> will help you keep your citizens well.",

  "Guide/#HousingDesirability_Title": "Housing and Desirability",
  "Guide/#HousingDesirability_Content": "The first step to building a neighborhood is to designate a housing area. Remember that all housing needs to be within two spaces of the road. Once you lay out an area, immigrants move in and set up simple huts. They forage the local countryside to find what they need to survive. As time passes, however, citizens begin to expect the city to provide for their needs. As you meet these expectations, citizens take it upon themselves to improve their housing conditions.  The quality of housing affects the city's <link=\"#Ratings_Title\"><u>ratings</u></link>, keeps citizens from emigrating and attracts new citizens to your city. \nCitizens' most basic needs are access to clean <link=\"#DrinkingWater_Title\"><u>water</u></link> and <link=\"#FoodFarming_Title\"><u>food</u></link> from <link=\"#Bazaar_Title\"><u>Bazaars</u></link>. Once you provide these two necessities, you will notice huts turning into more stable shanties and cottages. After food and water, citizens begin demanding a variety of goods and services. Citizens want supplies of <link=\"#Potter_Title\"><u>pottery</u></link>, <link=\"#Brewery_Title\"><u>beer</u></link> and <link=\"#Weaver_Title\"><u>linen</u></link> in their homes. The wealthiest citizens will also demand a supply of different <link=\"#Jeweler_Title\"><u>luxury goods</u></link>, such as jewelery.  As their tastes become more refined, they demand a second, imported luxury good. \nIn addition to these commodities, residents expect access to all their favorite services, like <link=\"#Religion_Title\"><u>religion</u></link>, <link=\"#Entertainment_Title\"><u>entertainment</u></link>, <link=\"#Education_Title\"><u>education</u></link> and <link=\"#Health_Title\"><u>health care</u></link>. Providing all these goods and services inspires residents to improve their homes into large and stately structures. Residents also want to live in attractive neighborhoods. You can establish fine <link=\"#Garden_Title\"><u>Gardens</u></link> and build <link=\"#Garden_Title\"><u>Statues</u></link>, or cover paved roads with <link=\"#Garden_Title\"><u>Plaza</u></link> tiles. \nCitizens will appreciate the effort you put into beautifying their surroundings and will likely improve their housing to match. The corollary to wanting to live in attractive surroundings is not wanting to live in unattractive surroundings. Citizens balk if their housing is too close to industry or to farms. They much prefer to live away from the loud noise and strong stench frequently emitted from these structures. Furthermore, most residents think that industrial structures are eyesores. If you must place housing near industries (and sometimes you must, to make sure that industries are staffed), try to compensate for the inconvenience with plenty of Gardens, Statues and Plazas and the easiest of access to desired goods and services. Ultimately, though, you will probably have to resign yourself to having some industrial slums blighting the city. \nThe advantages of high-quality housing are many. Highly evolved housing has a positive effect on the <link=\"#Ratings_Title\"><u>Prosperity Rating</u></link>. Evolved housing also holds more residents, which allows you to increase the city's population - and potentially the workforce - without designating new housing areas. Once your housing reaches the highest levels, residents become <link=\"#Scribes_Title\"><u>scribes</u></link>, who pay taxes but leave the city's workforce.

  "Guide/#Roads_Title": "Roads",
  "Guide/#Roads_Content": "Roads begin as dirt paths. As conditions in the city improve, its residents take it upon themselves to pave roads. Once a road is paved, you can place <link=\"#Garden_Title\"><u>Plazas</u></link> over it. Efficiently planned roads can go a long way to ensure that your city runs smoothly. <link=\"#Walkers_Title\"><u>Walkers</u></link> who provide services to your city move easier over long, straight roads rather than short roads with lots of twists, turns and intersections. Nearly all structures in your city need access to roads. The only exceptions are Gardens, Statues, and Forts. Shrines, Walls and housing do not need direct road access, but must be within two spaces of the road to receive benefits from passing walkers. \nWalkers can only cross the boundary between the flood plain and dry land where there's a road. This embankment is steep, muddy and treacherous, but a road permits safe passage. All roads have the same traffic capacity, and walkers move at the same speed, regardless of whether or not they are paved.\n\nThe Kingdom Road: The road running through your lands when you begin a new mission is the Kingdom road, and it has a special status. Trade caravans and immigrants arrive on the Kingdom road, and emigrants leave by it. Every part of your city needs a clear path to the Kingdom road. If you isolate some part of the city from this important thoroughfare, that area will stagnate. Any delivery people who were en route to the now-isolated enclave will stop in their tracks until access is restored. This doesn't mean that every one of your city's streets has to physically connect to the Kingdom road, merely that all buildings must have a clear, walkable path, whether via road or empty land. Chances are that this is all you need to know about the Kingdom road.\n\nBuilding on Two Roads: Sometimes, you might place a building adjacent to two roads that are either unconnected to each other, or connected far from the building. This does not let walkers leave or enter the building from both roads. Every building can have only one entry and one exit point and so only one active road. For example, suppose that you build a Storage Yard with a road on its southern side. Manufacturers, caravans and Bazaar buyers south of the Storage Yard will interact with it just as you would expect. Now say that you want industries north of the yard to use it, too.  If you build a road on the northern side of the Storage Yard, you might expect that industries to the north will interact with the yard using the northern road, while industries to the south will continue to use the road to the south. But the building can have only one access point, so those industries to the north are out of luck unless you build a connector between the northern and southern roads. When a building does have two or more roads adjacent to it, it chooses its access point by going clockwise around the building starting from the northern corner. \nTo avoid unpredictable behavior, don't construct buildings that touch two unconnected roads. Either connect the roads, or know that only one of them will actually carry traffic that can interact with the building. By hovering your mouse over a building, the game will show you its actual access points.",
  "Guide/#WaterCrossings_Title": "Water Crossings",
  "Guide/#WaterCrossings_Content": "There are two types of water crossings: Bridges and Ferry Landings. \nBridges can only span short lengths of water. Ships cannot sail underneath Bridges, so be sure to use them only when the body of water the bridge is spanning is not host to any ship traffic. Bridges can only be placed where the shoreline is straight. The corresponding shore on the opposite side must also be straight. When you pick an appropriate spot for a Bridge, you will see a green footprint of the Bridge along with its cost (Bridges are priced per tile). If you have not picked an appropriate place, you will see red squares. Bridges do not require any labor but do require road access. \nFerries dock at Ferry Landings and work much like Bridges, but are more versatile. Ferries do not impede the path of any other boats, so all sorts of ships can come and go as they please. Like Bridges, Ferry Landings must be placed on a straight piece of coastline. When you select an appropriate place, you will see a green square. You do not have to place the second Ferry Landing directly opposite the first. You can choose from a range of places on the other shore, provided the coastline is straight. Green blocks will highlight the appropriate places. \nBecause immigrants and emigrants use their own boats, they can use Ferry Landings as soon as they are placed. Ferry Landings must have workers, though, to transport other citizens. <link=\"#Walkers_Title\"><u>Walkers</u></link> with a specific destination in mind, such as delivery men, Bazaar buyers, and entertainers walking to their venues, use the ferries. No other walkers are allowed on the ferries. To transport immigrants, Ferry Landings do not need road access. Immigrants will cut across fields to get to the Ferry Landing.

The effects of irrigation are not cumulative; as long as there is one Irrigation Ditch within two spaces of a farm, the farm is fully irrigated. Floodplain farms are at the water's level where Irrigation Ditches can be connected directly to the Nile.  Meadow farms, however, are not at the water's level. To irrigate meadow farms, you must build a Water Lift. \nWater Lifts bring water up one level. They can be built on land adjacent to a body of water or to the flood plain. For Water Lifts built adjacent to the flood plain, you must build an Irrigation Ditch running from the Nile to the front of the Water Lift to supply it with water. Attach an Irrigation Ditch to the back of the Water Lift to irrigate meadow farms. Irrigation Ditches automatically run under roads as needed. Increasing the fertility of its land will increase the amount of food a farm yields. Fertility has no effect on the length of the growing season.

Building defensive structures may prevent enemies from ever setting foot within the city proper.

Fully surrounding a zone with defensive structures protects all of it.\n\nWalls: The most basic defensive structure is the Wall. To build Walls, choose them from the Military Structures. Click and drag the mouse to build large sections of a Wall at one time, just as you can do with roads. Walls are built from whichever natural materials are at hand, so no stone needs to be quarried or imported to build them. They are nevertheless expensive to build, so think carefully about the perimeter that you want to enclose. Walls do not need road access and are undesirable neighbors. The natural defense zone of a Wall is 1 tile.\n\nTowers: Build Towers to add a little offense to your defensive Walls. Towers are manned by guards trained by the city's <link=\"#Recruiter_Title\"><u>Recruiter</u></link> to hurl arrows on any enemies brave or foolhardy enough to come within range. Towers must be built into Walls that are two layers thick; if there are no walls, placing a tower will automatically construct them, making them pricier in the process. They also require road access, employees and sentries from a Recruiter's office. Towers can be upgraded with plain stone and their sentry with composite bows. Towers will make a good addition to your army value in case of attack. The natural defense zone of a Tower is 6 tiles, plus 3 for each upgrade up to a total of 12. \n\nGatehouses: As comforting as it would be, you cannot completely encircle your city with Walls. To let immigrants and merchant trade caravans in, you must have Gatehouses. Build Gatehouses where your major access roads meet your city Walls. While you are holding the mouse cursor over the desired location, press 'R' to change the direction the Gatehouse is facing. Once placed, Gatehouses will automatically attach to any adjacent Walls. Like Roadblocks, Gatehouses permit destination walkers free passage but turn roaming walkers back (click <link=\"#Walkers_Title\"><u>here</u></link> for more on walkers). Gatehouses have a natural defense zone of 3 tiles, and fully enclosing a zone with walls and a gatehouses to allow walkers to reach it will completely protect it.\n\nForts: While not defensive structures themselves, forts contribute their own defense zone.

The entranceway, which juts from the side of the monument, must be on clear land. You'll know you've selected a good spot when the entire footprint turns green. Click the mouse button to lock the monument into place. You might find it helpful to temporarily flatten the cliff terrain while you are searching for a suitable spot to place the monument. \nOnce an appropriate site is designated, you will need an able workforce, headed by <link=\"#ConstructionGuilds_Title\"><u>stonemasons</u></link> from a Stonemasons' Guild to carve the rock and <link=\"#ConstructionGuilds_Title\"><u>carpenters</u></link> from a Carpenters' Guild to build the necessary scaffolding.

Please note, though, that Major Plagues are not the same thing as <link=\"#Health_Title\"><u>plague</u></link>. Plague strikes the city when city health is particularly bad. Major Plagues may strike for no reason at all. All of the Major Plagues result in lower <link=\"#PopulationGrowth_Title\"><u>city sentiment</u></link>. Their other dire consequences are described below:\n\nRiver of Blood: When the River of Blood strikes the city, the river and waters of your city will turn to blood for several months and be unfit for <link=\"#DrinkingWater_Title\"><u>drinking water</u></link> and other uses. Some of the water that houses store on site will also be contaminated and undrinkable, with those living closest to the river feeling the effects the most. People living near the water will also be at an even greater risk for disease and malaria (for more details on disease and malaria, see <link=\"#Health_Title\"><u>city health</u></link>). <link=\"#FishingWharf_Title\"><u>Fishing Wharves</u></link>, <link=\"#Irrigation_Title\"><u>Water Lifts</u></link>, <link=\"#WoodCutter_Title\"><u>Reed Gatherers</u></link>, <link=\"#Well_Title\"><u>Wells</u></link> and <link=\"#WaterSupply_Title\"><u>Water Supplies</u></link> will stop working during the plague.\n\nFrogs: When the Plague of Frogs is visited upon your city, legions of frogs invade your borders and infest any houses they pass. No one can live in a frog-infested house, so the residents are forced out, and no one can move back in for several months. You can try to contain the frogs by building walls around them or strategically positioning buildings to pen them in.\n\nHailstorm: Deadly hailstones are the progeny of Hailstorms, which can kill anyone walking in your city. Hailstones are non-discriminatory and can kill soldiers (including enemies) and animals just as easily as they can kill ordinary citizens. Hailstorms also bring violent turbulence to the river, and many of your ships may sink.\n\nLocusts: Locusts descend upon the land and devour any crops your <link=\"#FoodFarming_Title\"><u>farms</u></link> are growing. The crops on both the flood plain and meadowland will be completely destroyed just before the harvest, robbing your city of the harvest's benefit for the year.",

You probably have a passing familiarity with the classical names, but the Egyptian option lends a bit more authenticity to Pharaoh. To control the way you receive messages while playing, adjust the Popup Messages settings. Most of the messages you receive appear in a popup screen.

In most cases, the columns indicate access to a particular service or city function.  The higher the column, the better the building's access to the service. The exceptions to the rule are the Risks Overlays, the Problems Overlay, the Desirability Overlay and the Hide Cliffs Overlay.  With the Risks Overlays, housing and other buildings are still replaced by columns, but the taller and redder the column the greater the risk.  The Problems Overlay shows the buildings that are not operating properly or that are about to develop a serious problem.  Icons indicating the problem appear on top of the building.  This overlay also shows cart pushers who have stalled because they have no place to bring their goods or food. With the Desirability Overlay selected, the city's land is replaced by different colored blocks.  Gold blocks indicate the areas that people find the most desirable.

Finally, the Water Overlay is a little different from the other overlays as well. Access to water carriers is shown with blue columns that grow taller with better access.  This overlay also shows which land can support water-related structures and which land has access to drinking water from a well.

Some of these messages are urgent and require quick response on your part.  They could be requests from Pharaoh or other cities, or could be directing your attention to a particular trouble spot in your city. When a new message arrives, the 'Message' button on the Control Panel lights up and a chime sounds.  Click on the button to read the message.  If the matter is extremely urgent, the message is delivered to you directly and appears on the screen automatically.  If the message is alerting you to some trouble in your city, you can click on the alarm button within the message to proceed directly to the trouble spot.   Other messages contain instructions that help you manage the city more successfully.  These messages are useful guides that teach important game concepts and set up short-term goals.  Meeting the short-term goals outlined in these special messages enables you to win a mission and move on to the next step.  These messages are marked with a blue scroll in the message list. You can erase individual messages by right-clicking on their titles in your message list.  A button at the bottom of the panel lets you delete all previously-opened messages at once, although it won't delete unread or blue-scroll (tutorial) messages.  Once you delete a message from the list, it is gone forever. You can, of course, choose to keep the message for future reference.

  "Legacy/CompanyOrders_Content": "To station a <link=\"#_Title\"><u></u></link>37company in the field, or to simply instruct it to move to a new location, click on it and then click on a new location.  The company's standard will appear in the new location, and the company will march towards it, assuming that the soldiers can get there.  Note that the steep, muddy embankment between a flood plain and dry land is impassible except where a road connects the two terrains.   You can issue a company the following orders:  \nHold Ground in Tight Formation In tight formation, soldiers stand as close to each other as possible.  Because they have been told to hold ground, they will not leave their position to attack enemies.  They will attack any enemy that comes within their range, though.  The tight formation reduces the amount of ground that the soldiers can defend and makes them an easier target for enemy arrows.  Their shoulder-to-shoulder stance enhances their defensive strength in close combat.   \nHold Ground in Loose Formation  This command can only be issued to infantry and archers; it cannot be issued to charioteers.  Soldiers in loose formation spread out to cover more ground while holding their positions.  They will attack if an enemy comes into range.  This formation makes infantry and archers less vulnerable to enemy arrows, but does not offer much protection against enemy infantry attack, as each soldier in the line can effectively only defend himself.   \nEngage Nearby Enemies When given this order, a company moves to attack enemies in their immediate vicinity.  The attack continues until the enemy is killed or retreats, or until you issue a different order...or until your own defeated company's morale breaks and your men head back to their Fort. \nMop-Up   When told to mop-up, soldiers seek out any enemies in a wide area and attack them.  Companies under mop-up orders are at their most aggressive, and they break formation entirely to fearlessly battle the foe.  Fearlessness, however, does hamper their ability to defend themselves, so this order is best used when the city's army outnumbers its enemies.   \nCharge  The charge command can be issued only to charioteers.  Charging an enemy line breaks up its formation, making the enemy more vulnerable to attack.  When told to charge, the charioteers work the horses up into a lather, and they pull the chariots at top speed for a great distance.  Eventually, the horses tire and the chariots slow down and need to rest, so issue this order sparingly.   \nReturn to Fort   Click Return to Fort when your soldiers have done their duty and defeated the enemy.  At the Fort, they can rest up for the next battle.   If morale is low, they'll return to Fort on their own.  \nIn addition to issuing the specific orders outlined above, you can also tell companies to attack by selecting them and clicking on an enemy.  The company will pursue the targeted enemy to the death unless you issue a different order. \nFor more on ancient Egyptian warfare, click <link=\"#_Title\"><u></u></link>184here.",

Establishing Thinis as a thriving city, like nothing ever seen before, will prove the worthiness of the Thinite confederacy, and help them gain supremacy over Lower Egypt and the other factions vying for power. \n\nIn time, this will mean providing the population with entertainment, and building wonderful temples to worship the region's patron deity.

An unruly mob, egged on by Cleopatra's younger brother Ptolemy XIII, has cornered Caesar and his men in the royal quarter of the city. Bitter street fighting has erupted, claiming many casualties. In a bid to keep his seaward escape route open, Caesar burned the Egyptian fleet as it lay at anchor in Alexandria's harbor.

The lead elements of this force are currently encamped on the outskirts of the small village of Maritis, on the eastern shore of Lake Mariut, preparing for the final leg of their journey.

Pharaoh wishes his burial place to be somewhat more modest, and therefore less attractive to rogues, than his forebears.
